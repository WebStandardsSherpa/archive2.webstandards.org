<h1>Accessible HTML/XHTML Forms</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this first look at forms and accessibility we'll cover the very basics you 
  should consider if you are to help as many users as possible to interact with 
  you and your web site just as you would like them to.</p>
<p>Forms are often the most tricky aspect of web development for beginners to 
  get their head around, largely because it means stepping out of the comfort 
  zone of one-way information - no longer are you simply presenting information 
  at the person viewing your site, now you are asking for input, for feedback 
  that you have to process in some way. And just as it may be difficult for HTML 
  beginners to understand just how they handle form data, so is it difficult to 
  understand some of the issues relating to accessibility.</p>
<p>Static content presented to the person visiting your site may be perfectly 
  well understood by someone using a screen reader, or perhaps a Braille computer, 
  assuming you've used semantic, structural markup (such as <code>h1</code> - 
  <code>h6</code> for headings). However, for someone visiting your site and simply 
  reading the content is quite a passive activity - they can take it or leave 
  it, whatever that 'it' may be. But with a form, the visitor has found something 
  that they <em>want</em> to interact with and suddenly the playing field has 
  changed - it's a two-way street. Now, marking up your pages becomes crucial 
  if you are to capture the correct information.</p>
<h2>HTML Entities Used</h2>
<p>The following are the HTML entities that you will use in your forms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element (your container for everything that 
    is to follow)</li>
  <li><code>&lt;input&gt;</code> - which includes many types, including text, 
    submit, button, radio button and checkbox</li>
  <li><code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> - for entering multi-line text, such as comments</li>
  <li>and the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element - otherwise known as the drop-down-list, 
    or the pull-down menu (depending on your preference)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element but this hasn't been seen 
  in wide usage since the steam engine was invented.</p>
<p>These elements are rendered and behave almost identically on different (GUI-based) 
  browsers. There may be some styling changes from one browser to another, but 
  essentially, a text input looks like a text input and a drop-down-list will 
  behave as a drop-down list. In theory, using forms should be easy for everybody, 
  regardless of the device or browser they are using.</p>
<h2>The Basics of Layout</h2>
<p>When you see a newspaper story, you read the heading and know that the text 
  to follow is related to that, and the text that appears underneath a photo is 
  the caption for that photo. Sometimes a page layout may differ from that expectation, 
  and you may have to work harder to understand what's going on - two photos with 
  one caption sitting between them. OK, you're clever, you can work it out.</p>
<p>With forms there are some well recognized CHI (Computer-Human Interaction) 
  principles with forms that, like the newspaper analogy, mean that if you do 
  things a certain way, these forms will be more easy to use. Because of this, 
  some adaptive technologies, such as screen readers, follow those principles 
  when interpreting a page that contains a form. As such, if they encounter a 
  text input, they <em>expect</em> that the text related to it comes before that 
  input ... and so it goes looking for it! So, if a screen reader sees something 
  like this it has difficulty:</p>
<p><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;firstname&quot; id=&quot;firstname&quot; 
  /&gt; - Please enter your first name&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;surname&quot; id=&quot;surname&quot; 
  /&gt; - Please enter your surname&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</code></p>
<p>Why? Because it <em>may</em> incorrectly associate the second input with the 
  first line of text, as if you had this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;surname&quot; id=&quot;surname&quot; 
  /&gt;&lt;-- Please enter your first name&lt;br /&gt;</code></p>
<p><img src="images/incorrect-association.gif" alt="Form element is associated with incorrect text" width="415" height="62" /></p>
<p>It's a recipe for disaster. But who puts the text after the input, we hear 
  you cry? Well, for some inputs this is actually the <em>correct</em> way of 
  doing things:</p>
<p><code>&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;athome&quot; id=&quot;athome&quot; 
  /&gt; Please call me at home&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;atwork&quot; id=&quot;atwork&quot; 
  /&gt; Please call me at work&lt;br&nbsp;/&gt;</code></p>
<form name="form1" id="form1" method="post" action="#">
  <p>Why is it this way round? Consider a long series of checkboxes. Using the 
    layout above, everything lines up neatly:</p>
  <p class="no-indent">
    <input type="checkbox" name="athome" id="athome" />
    Please call me at home<br />
    <input type="checkbox" name="atwork" id="atwork" />
    Please call me at my workplace<br />
    <input type="checkbox" name="atshack" id="atshack" />
    Please call me at the shack<br />
  </p>
  <p>But if you had it the other way around, it would be rendered like this:</p>
  <p class="no-indent">Please call me at home <input type="checkbox" name="at-home" id="at-home" />
    <br />
    Please call me at my workplace 
    <input type="checkbox" name="at-work" id="at-work" />
    <br />Please call me at the shack <input type="checkbox" name="at-shack" id="at-shack" />
</p>
</form>
<p>If you do nothing else, follow this advice and <strong>your forms will automatically 
  become more accessible</strong> because this is how assistive devices <em>expect</em> 
  them to be set out:</p>

<h2>But What About Accessibility?</h2>
<p>What? Oh yes, there's not been much mention of any of 'the accessibility tags'. 
  Trust us, by following the guidelines above and laying out your forms according 
  to recognised CHI principles, you will be making your forms more accessible 
  and usable. For now, it's about establishing good practices and keeping things 
  simple (we''ll build on this foundation very soon). And in the spirit of keeping 
  it simple, we should consider how scripting is used (and not used) to make forms 
  more accessible.</p>
<h2>This Script Sucks</h2>
<h3>Don't assume scripting is enabled</h3>
<p>A form should be usable regardless of whether scripting is enabled within a 
  browser (if it even supports scripting - remember, some assistive devices do 
  not support scripts at all). Server-side validation and manipulation of form 
  data mean that it is eminently possible to do this. However, many developers 
  still rely heavily on client-side scripting for validation or simply for triggering 
  events (for example, here is is a form that is totally reliant on scripting 
  being enabled for it to work: <code>&lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Place 
  order&quot; onclick=&quot;document.forms('main'.submit();&quot;&nbsp;/&gt;</code> 
  where <code>&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Place order&quot;&nbsp;/&gt;</code> 
  would do the job equally well).</p>
<p><strong>Ensure that your form works with scripting disabled</strong> - let 
  the server do the work!</p>
<h3>Avoid JavaScript for Navigation</h3>
<p>On the other hand, what if you are using JavaScript do do something with a 
  form element that takes control away from the user? The classic example of this 
  is the drop-down-list used as a navigation tool. Many sites use these in such 
  a way that when you select an item from the list you are automatically taken 
  to the page. However, these are very difficult to use (if not impossible) for 
  people who cannot use a mouse (this includes blind users with screen readers, 
  people with motor deficiencies and more). </p>
<p><img src="images/inaccessible-ddl-nav.gif" alt="The options in this dro-down list are difficult, if not impossible, to use without a mouse" width="382" height="211" /></p>
<p>Consequently, using the keyboard to change the list always results in the first 
  item in the list being selected and activated. Trying to be clever has thrown 
  in an accessibility hurdle. Keep it simple - use a drop-down-list if you want, 
  but allow the user to activate the selection using a Go button, like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/ddl-with-go-button.gif" alt="Drop-down list made accessible by addition of a Go button" width="397" height="54" /></p>
<h2>A Note About Tables</h2>
<p>Another accessibility gotcha with forms is that they are invariably set out 
  using tables to achieve a nice grid-like effect. This is not always an automatic 
  accessibility problem, but it can be - a table layout is irrelevent to a screen 
  reader which effectively reads the content in the order it appears in the source 
  code. If you decide to split the text and the form element that the text relates 
  to, you will get unstuck. This is because the screen reader 'linearizes' the 
  content and then gets things badly wrong, as this image demonstrate:</p>
<p><img src="images/confusing-table-layout.gif" alt="Table layouts for forms can confuse screen readers if you are not careful" width="492" height="194" /></p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>So, those are a few basic rule regarding layout and positioning of form elements 
  and the associated text which will get you off to a good start. In the intermediate 
  page we'll start to look at some of the HTML elements that specifically aid 
  accessibility, including <code>label</code>, <code>fieldset</code>, <code>legend</code> 
  and <code>optgroup</code>. </p>
