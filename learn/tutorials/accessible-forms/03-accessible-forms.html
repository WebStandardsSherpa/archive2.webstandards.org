<h1>Accessible HTML/XHTML Forms</h1>
<div class="update">Created: May 2004 | Author: <a href="../../../about/bios/illoyd.html">Ian 
      Lloyd</a></div>
<p><a href="01-accessible-forms.html">Beginning Level</a> | <a href="02-accessible-forms.html">Intermediate</a> | Advanced</p>

<p>You've covered the <a href="01-accessible-forms.html">basics of form layout</a>, 
  you've read about some of the <a href="02-accessible-forms.html">lesser-known 
  XHTML tags</a> at your disposal and you're ready to take on the world. Your 
  forms are accessible and you, truly, are invincible. Well, the reality is that 
  you can always go that extra mile, and even when you do there may be a few things 
  that can bite you on the bum if you're not looking. In this section we'll try 
  to cover off these aspects in as timely a fashion as possible.</p>
<h2>Where Am I Now?</h2>
<p>Using a mouse it's invariably quite easy to see where you are in a web page. 
  With a bigger mouse cursor and mouse trails switched on (if this is available 
  to you) it becomes even easier. However, if you are sighted but cannot use a 
  mouse for whatever reason, you will be forced to use the keyboard to navigate 
  around and will not have the audio prompts that blind users would receive from 
  a screen reader. Sometimes, it can be difficult to see where the point of focus 
  is on screen. Browsers may employ a dotted line around the form element that 
  is currently in focus, but you can make it even easier ...</p>
<p>In Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 (CSS2), there is a pseudo property <code>focus</code> 
  that can be applied to any HTML element but is particularly effective with forms. 
  It is not universally supported in the current range of web browsers, but does 
  work in Mozilla-based browsers. Using the following:</p>
<p><code>input:focus, select:focus, textarea:focus {<br />
  background:red;<br />
  color:white; <br />
  }</code></p>
<p>... would result in a very eye-catching indicator when you tab through a form, 
  making your form much easier to use/interact with for anyone with motor deficiencies:</p>
<p><img src="images/field-in-focus.gif" alt="Field in focus is clearly visible" width="366" height="61" /></p>
<h2>Accesskeys in Inputs and Labels</h2>
<p>An accesskey is potentially a very useful accessibility tool that you can put 
  to good use on any web site. Sadly, though, the theory and the practice could 
  not be further apart.The theory is simple - associate a keystroke of your choosing 
  to any given element on a page, making it very easy to access that element quickly. 
  For example, a search field that appears on the top of every page might be assigned 
  an accesskey of 's'. </p>
<p><code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;txtsearch&quot; accesskey=&quot;s&quot; 
  /&gt;</code></p>
<p>In practice, all the best keystroke/activity mappings are already claimed by 
  the various browsers and assistive devices out there (in many different languages 
  too). Consequently, if you want to use <code>accesskey=&quot;f&quot;</code> 
  when referring to, say, the first name in a form that captures personal details, 
  you may come unstuck. Why? Because pressing alt + f (alt being the modifier 
  key that is normally used to trigger the accesskey) is more likely to bring 
  up the browser's file menu.</p>
<p>Note, though, that you can just as easily apply an accesskey to a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> 
  element as you can to the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. The problem is that there 
  is no easy way of alerting to the user what the accesskey being used is (only 
  iCab gives any hint to users of the acceskey available). One suggested way is 
  to use the underline method that is used in Windows-based applications, sometimes 
  called accelerator keys:</p>
<p><code>&lt;label for=&quot;txtsearch&quot; accesskey=&quot;S&quot;&gt;&lt;span 
  class=&quot;accelerator&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;earch:&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input 
  type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;txtsearch&quot; id=&quot;txtsearch&quot; /&gt;</code></p>
<p>You would need to specify that the class of accelerator gives an underline 
  effect (don't simply use a <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tag instead!).</p>
<p><code>.accelerator {text-decoration:underline;}</code></p>
<h2>Error reporting</h2>
<p>When you or I make a mistake when filling out a form, there are a number of 
  different ways that this can be handled. </p>
<ol>
  <li>One way is to use client-side scripting (JavaScript) that stops the form 
    being submitted if any details are incorrect. Of course, if JavaScript is 
    disabled - and to ensure your web pages are accessible you need to bear this 
    in mind - this alerting may not be of any use. Therefore ...</li>
  <li>You use the other method as a backup, that being server-side validation 
    and subsequent error reporting.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Client-side Error Reporting</h3>
<p>Let us assume that the browser has Javascript enabled (otherwise, you can just 
  skip on to the next section heading, Server-side Error Reporting). This being 
  the case, there are so many different ways to do the scripting but that's not 
  within the scope of this article. However, there are some ways that will be 
  more accessible than others which we can look at.</p>
<p>Often, when JavaScript form validation is used, all the errors are collected 
  in one go and displayed in bulk to the user in one giant alert like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/big-alert.jpg" alt="Big alert box containing lots of information." width="404" height="177" /></p>
<p>Now, at the risk of harping on about blind users, just imagine getting this 
  information read out (or perhaps even more errors?) in one go. Irritating isn't 
  it? But then what do you do?</p>
<p>A better method might be to alert the first error encountered and take the 
  user back to that field to be corrected, and so on until all are covered. If 
  you know that JavaScript is enabled, well then you can use JavaScript to set 
  the focus back to the offending field, and perhaps add in some default text 
  to that field <em>and</em> select the text too:</p>
<p><img src="images/small-alert.jpg" alt="A smaller alert that is easier to take in, react to.\" width="404" height="139" /></p>
<p><code>document.forms['&quot;personaldetails&quot;].fullname.value=&quot;Please 
  enter your full name&quot;;<br />
  document.forms['&quot;personaldetails&quot;].fullname.select();</code></p>
<p>You could also use JavaScript to highlight the field in some other manner for 
  people who are sighted but could still benefit from some pointers. Maybe a bold 
  border around the field? Perhaps an eye-catching background color?</p>
<p>Some people will be screaming at the screen at this point saying that this 
  method above is repetitive and awkward where a number of errors are present. 
  Granted, for some users this may seem a pain, but at this point you have to 
  make a judgement call about whether the strive for accessibility is working 
  against the usability of the web site/page for the greater majority.</p>
<h3>Server-side Error Reporting</h3>
<p>Once a form is processed, and errors are found, the usual method is to present 
  a summary of the faults at the top of the page and highlight those parts of 
  the form in error visually. This seems OK, but if we take the idea of someone 
  using a screen reader, that information may not be immediately obvious (&quot;Well, 
  I've sent this form and I've got back to the same page ... what's going on?&quot;).</p>
<p>A simple trick - alert the problem in the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> field 
  (normally the first part of the page that a screen reader will announce if left 
  uninterrupted), and also in the main page heading.</p>
<p><code>&lt;title&gt;There was some missing date in the form you submitted: Personal 
  details&lt;/title&gt;</code></p>
<p>In the summary note at the top of your page, provide a link to the offending 
  form field that needs correcting. This will stop the person having to tab through 
  the entire form to find the field at fault.</p>
<p>&quot;Aha,&quot; I hear you cry, &quot;what if there are five errors? If they 
  follow the first link to correct the first one at fault, what about all the 
  others?&quot;</p>
<p>The last thing you want is for people to be going backwards and forwards all 
  over the place, and I don't want to suggest adding a 'back to top' link all 
  the way through the form. However, a little to-ing and fro-ing may be necessary. 
  You can make this a little less painless by informing the user how many errors 
  need correcting:</p>
<p><img src="images/five-errors.gif" alt="5 errors listed for the user" width="435" height="158" /></p>
<p>But maybe there's something more radical that you could do? Instead of sending 
  the same page back to the user with some completed fields, and some that are 
  broken/empty, you could try:</p>
<ul>
  <li>capturing the good data and storing it safely</li>
  <li>presenting <em>only</em> the incorrectly completed fields back to the user 
    to be completed</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of forcing the user to wade through the entire form and picking out 
  the fields in error, you simply display a subset to them with no other distraction.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>There are so many little - and not so little - tricks that one can employ using 
  a mixture of CSS and JavaScript to improve form accessibility that this article 
  could stretch for pages and pages. So, I'll just draw a line at this point and 
  leave the rest of the innovation up to you, dear reader.</p>
