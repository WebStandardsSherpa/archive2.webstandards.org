	<h1>Dreamweaver Task Force</h1>
	<!-- <h2 class="sub"></h2> -->
The WaSP Dreamweaver Task Force was created in 2001 to accomplish two
tasks of vital importance: 
 
<ol>
<li>To work with Macromedia&#8217;s engineers to improve the 
standards compliance and accessibility of web pages produced with 
Macromedia Dreamweaver, the market-leading professional visual web 
editor and development tool. Detailed objectives are listed below. 
This part of the group&#8217;s mission was largely fulfilled with the 
release in May 2002 of Dreamweaver MX, though the Task Force will 
continue to work with Macromedia as the company fine-tunes subsequent 
versions of its product.</li>
 
<li>To communicate effectively within the online Dreamweaver community, 
raising awareness of web standards and helping others discover how 
their tools can be used to create standards-compliant, accessible 
sites. This work will continue indefinitely and is a key component of 
WaSP&#8217;s developer education outreach program.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="../../../about/bios/randrew.html">Rachel Andrew</a> and 
<a href="../../../about/bios/dmclellan.html">Drew McLellan</a> have spearheaded 
both efforts, interfacing with 
<a href="../../../about/bios/dsmith.html">Dori Smith</a>, 
<a href="../../../about/bios/tnegrino.html">Tom Negrino</a>, and 
<a href="../../../about/bios/jzeldman.html">Zeldman</a>. 
Rachel and Drew were chosen because of their knowledge of web 
standards and accessibility, their esteemed positions within the 
Dreamweaver community, and because they said yes. They put in a 
phenomenal amount of work on behalf of the design and development 
community, as did Macromedia&#8217;s engineers, whose responsiveness to 
the Dreamweaver Task Force and its objectives has been remarkably open 
and accepting.</p>
 
<p> Listed below, exactly as they were originally written, are the 
objectives that guided the Task Force&#8217;s work with 
Macromedia&#8217;s engineers. These are followed by an <a 
href="mxassessed.html" 
title="An Assessment of Dreamweaver MX">assessment</a> of 
the standards compliance and accessibility of Dreamweaver MX and a 
short list of improvements we hope to see in future versions.</p>

<h2>Initial Objectives</h2>
<p>The WaSP Dreamweaver Task Force has set out a number of primary 
objectives. These are the main, fundamental points Dreamweaver should 
attain in order to be a useful tool for creating standards-compliant 
websites:</p>
 
<h3>Primary Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dreamweaver should produce valid mark-up &#8220;out of the box.&#8221;</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should allow the choice between <span class="abbr">XHTML</span> and <span class="abbr">HTML</span> 
versions, inserting a valid <span class="abbr">DTD</span> for each choice.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should respect a document&#8217;s <span class="abbr">DTD</span>, and produce 
markup and code in accordance with it.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should enable users to easily create web documents 
accessible to all.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should render <span class="abbr">CSS2</span> to a good level of accuracy, so 
that pages laid out with <span class="abbr">CSS</span> can be worked on within the Dreamweaver 
visual environment.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should not corrupt valid CSS layouts by inserting 
	inline styling without the user&#8217;s consent.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver users should feel confident that their 
Dreamweaver-created pages will validate and have a high level of 
accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Task Force believes that a designer should be able to use 
Dreamweaver to create valid hypertext documents by default. 
Additionally, Dreamweaver should, at the very least, properly render 
pages laid out with <span class="abbr">CSS</span>, if not create those layouts from within the 
tool. Importantly, Dreamweaver should not distress imported <span class="abbr">CSS</span> 
layouts created in other tools or by hand.</p>
 
<p>The WaSP Dreamweaver Task Force has an additional list of objectives, 
secondary to those listed above. These lie somewhere between 
&#8220;must-have&#8221; and &#8220;wish list:&#8221;</p>
 
<h3>Secondary Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dreamweaver should produce clean, tidy markup.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should, or should provide the mechanisms for, 
third-party extensions to respect the document&#8217;s <span class="abbr">DTD</span> and insert 
markup accordingly.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should provide clear mechanisms for third-party 
extension developers, enabling them to develop extensions that will not 
corrupt the validity or usefulness of a Dreamweaver user&#8217;s page. 
This applies for everything from markup validity through following 
accessibility settings.</li>
<li>The default settings in Dreamweaver should encourage the use of 
accessibility features and more up-to-date standards such as <span class="abbr">XHTML</span> 
and <span class="abbr">CSS</span>.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver should not encourage the use of deprecated tags or 
attributes by its default settings or interface design.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Working with the Dreamweaver Community</h3>
 
<p>An important part of the Task Force&#8217;s work is to be active 
within the very strong community of Dreamweaver users, promoting web 
standards and providing education in their use. Activities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introducing web standards to those who may be taking their first 
steps into web development, particularly those coming from a more 
design-based background.</li>
<li>While remaining on-topic and within the parameters of the 
Macromedia news groups, to answer posts by recommending methods that 
comply with web standards, and explaining the problems of sticking 
with deprecated markup and code.</li>
<li>Creating web tutorials for Dreamweaver users, showing how to employ 
web standards within Dreamweaver in a thoroughly practical way.</li>
<li>Developing resources to assist Dreamweaver users in getting the 
most out of Dreamweaver by creating compliant and accessible web 
pages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release of Macromedia Dreamweaver MX</h2>
<p>Macromedia released Dreamweaver MX in May 2002, offering vastly 
improved  standards compliance and accessibility over previous 
versions.  On the following page, The WaSP&#8217;s Dreamweaver Task Force <a
href="mxassessed.html">assesses the product&#8217;s compliance</a> with web
standards and discusses a few areas that might be improved in future
releases.</p>
