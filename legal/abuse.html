	<h1>The WaSP Hates Spam and Viruses</h1>
	<p>
	It has come to our attention that some spammers are now using code from
	the <a href="../act/campaign/buc/index.html">Browser Upgrade Campaign</a> in
	their spam messages, or on "spamvertised" Web sites. This is
    apparently done in order to discriminate against people using
    JavaScript-capable mail readers and browsers that do not provide
    support for W3C Web standards.
	</p>

	<ul>
	 <li>If you were directed here by your browser or mail client,
	  after receiving an unsolicited message, please read on.</li>

	  <li>If you followed a link and are looking for the Browser
	  Upgrade Campaign, please be advised that the URL has changed,
	  and we've stopped redirecting the old URL due to the abuse
	  we're now seeing.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	Please note that <strong>we had nothing to do with the unsolicited
	email</strong>!
	</p>

	<p>
	We find it amusing that spammers, intrusive and vile as they are,
	would choose to exclude some people from the messages those people
	didn't ask for in the first place. But the stupidity of spammers
	is not our concern.
	</p>

	<p>
	Unfortunately, one side effect of this abuse is to shift apparent
	blame for the spam onto the Web Standards Project. We have
	<em>never</em> sent any unsolicited bulk mail, and in fact only
	rarely do we use any email address in the webstandards.org domain
	for outbound mail. More commonly, our members reply to mail sent
	<em>to</em> webstandards.org email aliases using their own,
	private, email accounts.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you receive unsolicited mail claiming to be from this domain, the
	sender is almost certainly forged.
	</p>

	<p>
	Another manner in which mail claiming to be from this domain may be sent
	is by way of computer viruses or worms, such as Klez, which forge the
	sender address based on the infected system's address book. Usually, a
	quick inspection of the email headers can tell whether the mail was
	sent by the address claimed in the 'From:' header.
	More information about Klez can be found at Web sites maintained by
	anti-virus software vendors.
	For example, here is the page discussing Klez from 
<a href="http://vil.mcafee.com/dispVirus.asp?virus_k=99455">MacAfee</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you're running a vulnerable system, such as Windows, please be
	sure to use anti-virus software to protect the rest of us. If you'd
	like to notify someone of the virus, try your local IT staff or
	Internet service provider, or someone else who may be able to help
	you identify the sender.
	</p>

	<p>
	Please report such mail by forwarding the message to
	 <a href="mailto:abuse@webstandards.org">abuse@webstandards.org</a>.
	Include <em>full headers</em>; anything else is completely useless.
	(<a href="http://spamcop.net/fom-serve/cache/19.html">How?</a>)
	</p>

	<p>
	Please understand that we cannot reply to all such reports; we're an
	all-volunteer organization as it is, and the reports merely add to
	our burden. But we do want to track the rise of such abuse, and your
	help is appreciated.
