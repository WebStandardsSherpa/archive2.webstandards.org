                                <p><a href="http://news.com.com/" title="C|net news">C|Net</a> has an article about <a href="http://news.com.com/IE--embraced%2C+extended%2C+extinct%3F/2100-1032_3-5388831.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5388831&amp;subj=news.1032.5" title="C|net's article about the future of IE">the future of Internet Explorer</a>. Much of the article is speculation fueled by vague quotes from various Microsoft employees about how wonderful web browsing in Longhorn, the next version of Windows, will be.</p>

<p>Wade through the fluff, though, and there's a pretty good history of the browser wars and a reasonably accurate description of the state of the market today. Most significantly, the article makes the point that Microsoft isn't so interested in the web as a publishing medium; they've got their sights set on the web as an application platform. Exactly right, and that's where the action will be over the next few years.</p>

                                <p>According to <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0409adobegl80.html">ThinkSecret</a>,  a revived GoLive 8.0 will join <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0409adobecs20.html">Creative Suite v2.0</a> to be released in early 2005. The news item reports Adobe is working to improve the handling of CSS content including a toolbar for adjusting CSS layouts.</p><p>Also getting a makeover is the grid element for CSS DIV authoring for easy switching between DIV and T-t-table layout views.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how it handles CSS in comparison to Macromedia&#8217;s Dreamweaver. Will GoLive have a chance against Dreamweaver? Maybe it&#8217;s too late? Maybe not - after all, <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=1464&amp;t=1">Firefox</a> managed to shake up IE and Dreamweaver is not as dominant in Web authoring as IE is in Web browsing.</p>

                                <p>The wags over at <a href="http://slashdot.org/" title="Slashdot site">/.</a> are speculating that Google may <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/21/0011207" title="Slashdot post speculating on a Google-branded browser">release a browser</a>. Their evidence includes recent hires at Google and the fact that Google already owns the Gbrowser.com domain.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd say this one lands somewhere between 'unlikely' and 'I'll have some of whatever you're smoking' on the bullometer, but there's some fun speculation in the comments nevertheless. </p>

                                <p>Remember the bad old days of 2000-2001? Back when Netscape Communicator still had appreciable market share on most sites? If you were working with CSS layouts then you probably don't; your brain has buried that period deep in your subonscious mind. It's just too painful a memory to deal with. </p>

<p>Mine had done, anyway. And the backward-march of my hairline had slowed markedly as a result. I'd been sleeping peacefully through the night, with no wee-hours screaming about <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/1996/1/WD-jsss-960822" title="Netscape Communications' W3C submission for JavaScript Stylesheets">JavaScript stylesheets</a> and <a href="http://www.euronet.nl/~tekelenb/WWW/netscapebug/hack.html" title="Page describing the Netscape Communicator double-load bug">double-loading</a>. Then <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/" title="Eric Meyer's site">Eric Meyer</a> brought it all flooding back with his post about a <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/16/when-browsers-attack/" title="Eric Meyer's post about a crash-inducing CSS bug in IE for Windows">crash-inducing bug for IE/Win</a>.</p>

<p>So it's official, then: IE/Win has inherited Netscape 4.x's mantle as the red-headed stepchild of the browser market.</p>

<p>Here's hoping the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/" title="The IE team's blog">IE team</a> rights the ship post-haste. It's a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/08/17/216080.aspx" title="IE Blog post on the testing matrix for IE/Win">massive</a> project, but if anyone can do it, it's those guys.</p>

                                <p>MacRabbit is a new <a href="http://www.macrabbit.com/cssedit/" title="MacRabbit CSS editor home page">CSS editor</a> for the Mac. I haven't had a go with it yet, but the extraction feature alone, which allows you to suck down the CSS for an arbitrary site using a custom user agent string so you can 'spoof' different browsers and circumvent browser-sniffing, looks like it might be worth a shot.</p>

<p><br />Hat tippin': <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000596.html" title="Jeffrey Veen's blog">Jeffrey Veen</a></p>

<p><br /><strong>Update:</strong> Alert reader Joe Lewis notes that the program itself is called 'CSSEdit'. 'MacRabbit' is the company that develops it. Joe also gives the program a glowing review, saying he's been a happily-licensed user for several months already.</p>

<p>Thanks for clearing up the confusion, Joe! </p>

                                <p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer share has dropped from 95.6% in June to 93.7% this month. This is the most notable slip for IE's dominance in over seven years.</p>

<p>Mozilla browser share has grown from 3.5% to 5.2%.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">Spread Firefox</a> campaign is on, with a promotion to encourage one million downloads in ten days.  They're already halfway there!</p>

<p>Of course, WaSP continues to promote a better browsing experience via our <a href="http://www.browsehappy.com/">Browse Happy</a> web site.</p>

<p>The numbers might be small, but the rewards for those who have made the switch are indeed mighty.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://mozilla.org/" title="Mozilla Foundation's site">Mozilla Foundation</a> has released <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" title="Firefox product page">Firefox 1.0PR</a> (that's 'Preview Release', or 0.10, one of the last releases before it goes 1.0), <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/" title="Thunderbird product page">Thunderbird 0.8</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/" title="Mozilla Suite product page">version 1.7.3 of the Mozilla Suite</a>.</p>

<p>Especially noteworthy in this release is rudimentary support for <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/" title="Information site for the Atom Syndication Format">ATOM</a> and <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/advisoryBoard" title="Really Simple Syndication Advisory Board site">RSS</a> feeds. Neither RSS nor ATOM is a by-Hoyle web standard, though ATOM is being <a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html" title="IETF charter for the ATOM working group">standardized</a> by the <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr>. To my knowledge, despite the use of RSS by dozens of big-name publications like the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/help/3223484.stm" title="BBC's RSS feed help page">BBC</a> and <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/" title="The New York Times' RSS feed page">The New York Times</a></em>, there is no similar effort underway for that format. In fact, the person most influential in the RSS world, <a href="http://scripting.com/" title="Dave Winer's Scripting News">Dave Winer</a>, has expressly disavowed such a role for the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/advisoryBoard" title="Really Simple Syndication Advisory Board site">RSS Advisory Board</a> he founded. Nevertheless, these are two useful technologies. Cheers to the Mozilla Foundation for embracing them both.</p>

<p>Firefox displays a rectangular orangs 'RSS' icon on the right side of the status bar when you're browsing a site with an RSS or ATOM feed. Click the icon, and Firefox will add the feed to your bookmarks. It treats feeds as a folder, and individual items as bookmarks. It seems a bit kludgey to me, as there isn't any obvious way to see only article summaries rather than hitting the sites themselves.</p>

<p>In Thunderbird, one sets up a 'News &amp; Blogs' account and adds feeds there. One has the option of either loading descriptions or the full web page into the main window when one clicks on a headline, and can organize the feeds into folders. All in all, it's not unlike <a href="http://ranchero.com/" title="Ranchero Software site">Ranchero Software</a>'s <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" title="NetNewsWire product page; scroll to the bottom for the free Lite version">NetNewsWire Lite</a> for OS X, or a primitive version of <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/" title="Newsgator site">Newsgator</a>, a feed reader extension for Microsoft Outlook on Windows.</p>

<p>Both programs, and the suite, sport numerous other smaller improvements and bug fixes as well. If you haven't tried either yet, it's <a href="http://www.browsehappy.com/" title="BrowseHappy site">time</a> to give 'em a whirl.</p>

                                <h2 class="postTitle"><a name="a000437" id="a000437">Patents and Tabbing and Browsers &#8212; Oh My!</a></h2>

                                <p>A couple emailers have pointed out that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" title="Microsoft site">Microsoft</a> has apparently won a <a href="http://internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3406551" title="Internet News article on Microsoft's tabbing patent">patent on tab navigation of links in a browser</a>. </p>

<p>Theoretically, this means Microsoft could demand royalties from any company or organization whose browser allows users to find and navigate through links on a web page using the 'tab' key. Given that open source projects like the <a href="http://mozilla.org/" title="Mozilla Foundation site">Mozilla Foundation</a> lack the funds to pay such royalties, were Microsoft to enforce the patent it would seriously impact the accessibility of the web for people using their browsers.</p>

<p>In reality, despite the <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/08/026208" title="Slashdot article on the Microsoft tab navigation patent">fear</a> and <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/05/1618247" title="Slashdot article on a number of Microsoft patents, including tab navigation">loathing</a> the news has engendered in the open source community, I find this outcome unlikely in the extreme. In the first place, as the article linked above indicates, the patent needs to hold up in court. As other outfits have <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/19/pto_rules_on_eolas_patent/" title="Article on the U.S. Patent Office ruling against Eolas and the University of California in their dispute with Microsoft">discovered</a>, that's hardly a slam-dunk when it comes to broad patents like this. Second, Microsoft's statement from the article linked above doesn't seem to indicate any aggressive intent on their part:</p>

<blockquote><p>In response to a query from internetnews.com about how it planned to handle the patent, Microsoft said: "We respond to inquiries about our portfolio and typically have private collaborative discussions with companies about using our technology. Consistent with practice throughout our industry, we don't believe it's constructive to identify specific products and start labelling them as infringing or non-infringing."</p></blockquote>

<p>It's not as reassuring as Microsoft's statements about their <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,17741,00.html" title="Wired News article on Microsoft's stylesheet patent">patent on CSS</a>, but neither does it sound like the angry noises we heard from Eolas, or <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1572323,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594" title="eWeek article on Forgent Networks' JPEG patent claim">Forgent Networks</a>.</p>

<p>To me, it seems the real impact of this patent is to drive home just how misguided the U.S. intellectual property regime has become, particularly with regard to software patents &#8212; and why <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/resource/sep04/0904inve.html" title="IEEE Spectrum article on European software patents">Europe</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,64898,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_6" title="Wired News article on the U.S.-Australia free trade agreement">Australia</a> would do well to think twice before running headlong down that same path, as they appear to be doing.</p>

<p>This isn't really a 'standards' issue, to be honest. It's a social/legal/economic one. As such, I feel it's really outside the scope of Buzz. I'll just leave it now with the observation that lots and lots of bigcos amass patents as a hedge against someone coming after <em>them</em> for patent infringement: "Oh, so we infringed your patent did we? Well <em>you</em> infringed <em>our</em> patent first!" It's a seven-figure-settlement version of schoolyard squabbling, as in the recent <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/05/13/macromedia_wins_4_9m/" title="The Register's article on the Macromedia-Adobe patent fight">Macromedia-Adobe brou-ha-ha</a>. Distasteful? Sure. But it happens. And Microsoft would be remiss if they didn't try to protect themselves.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.paulbellows.com/" title="Paul Bellows' site">Paul Bellows</a> has <a href="http://www.paulbellows.com/getsmart/balance_columns/" title="Paul Bellows' ECMAScript technique for balancing CSS-based columns">revisited</a> the even-height CSS columns question discussed in a <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2004_09.html#a000431" title="Buzz post on even-height CSS columns via the CSS table-layout properties">couple</a> of <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2004_09.html#a000426" title="Buzz post on a method for creating multiple, flexible-width, even-height columns with CSS">previous</a> posts.</p>

<p>Paul's method uses <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturer's Association Script">ECMAScript</abbr>, the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and some non-standard properties to work it's magic. Personally, I'm not a big fan of using ECMAScript for basic layout. Neither is Paul, truth be told. But at the end of the day, some <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ieblog" title="The Microsoft Internet Explorer Team's  blog">browsers</a> need a bit of help doing the right thing.</p>

<p>Is Paul's method any better than the <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/03/sliding-faux-columns/" title="Eric Meyer's discussion of a technique for defining even-height, flexible-width columns with CSS">Eric Meyer</a>/<a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2004/09/03/liquid-bleach.html" title="Douglas Bowman's discussion of a technique for defining even-height, flexible-width columns with CSS">Douglas Bowman</a> method? I'm not sure. A bit of ECMAScript doesn't seem to me any worse a hack than an oh-my-&amp;deity wide background image or a lightweight layout <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>. Yet I'm not sure I like the idea that the layout relies on visitors having ECMAScript enabled on their browsers, particularly considering the well-publicized <a href="http://www.browsehappy.com/" title="Browse Happy: a site discussing IE's security issues and alternative browsers">security issues</a> some browsers have.</p>

<p>On balance, while I really haven't had a chance to work through Paul's method enough to form a firm opinion, I probably lean towards a pure-CSS or even the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>-based solution.</p>

<p>Still, it's good that Paul has taken the time to explore this avenue and post his results. At the very least, it may form the basis for solutions in places where other techniques fall down. So if you have a free moment, spin by his site, look over &#8212; or try out &#8212; his code and send him some feedback.</p>

<p>While you're there, give a listen to some of Paul's <a href="http://www.paulbellows.com/record.php" title="Paul Bellows' punk-pop music">tunes</a>: like <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/" title="Scott Andrew's site">Scott Andrew</a> Paul's a gifted musician and recording artist as well as a skilled scripter. Where <em>do</em> they find the time?</p>

                                <p>More sites jumping on the CSS + structural markup bandwagon:</p>

<p>Firtst, <a href="http://www.happycog.com/" title="Happy Cog Studios' site">Happy Cog Studios</a> has redesigned the <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/" title="Amnesty International USA">Amnesty International USA</a> site. <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman's site">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> discusses the challenges of <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0904b.shtml" title="Jeffrey Zeldman's post regarding the challenges of the Amnesty International USA redesign">working with a large site on a tight budget</a> and his experience with the dreaded <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2004_09.html#a000418" title="Buzz post on the RE/MAX redesign which explains the 3rd party problem">3rd party problem</a>. He also has a more complete discussion of the issues <a href="http://www.happycog.com/work/ai/" title="Developer-oriented case study of the Amnesty Inernational USA site">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next up, telecomms giant <a href="http://www.att.com/" title="AT&amp;T's site">AT&amp;T</a> has pulled off a valid XHTML strict home page, complete with a Flash movie (yeah, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> might be nice, but realistically browser and plugin support just hasn't reached practical levels). Go Ma Bell, go!</p>

<p>Finally, the open source <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/" title="Mono Project's site">Mono Project</a> has come within three errors of validation. The gotchas are small: a non-standard attibute value, a missing <code>alt</code> attribute and a missing <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag. While not technically valid, they are using clean, semantic markup and that's the most important thing. Besides, I'm inclined to cut 'em a bit of slack on the site &#8212; replicating Microsoft's .Net framework as a cross-platform API is a momentous undertaking, and little details like three piddling validation errors on the site are bound to get overlooked here or there while they persue the greater goal.</p>

<p><br />Hat-tip to <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/" title="Eric Meyer's site">Eric Meyer</a> and the 'Redesign Watch' item he's got tucked away in the right-hand column of his site.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Update:</strong> Joe D'Andrea of the AT&amp;T web team emailed to say that we haven't seen nothing yet. </p>

<p>Joe's team has completed makeovers of some 30 pages on the site, and are slowly but surely working through the remainder. Meantime, he says they've got some serious <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> and <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturer's Association">ECMAScript</abbr> goodness up their sleeves, and after that will be moving on to <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/mentary/past/ifr_revisited_and_revised.php" title="Shaun Inman's article on the Inman Flash Replacement technique">IFR</a> and <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2004/08/sifr" title="Mike Davidson's discussion of the sIFR Flash replacement technique">sIFR</a>. Ultimately, Joe says they're aiming for zero inline ECMAScript and all page behavior defined through context and content. Woohoo!</p>

<p>It's great to see that a decade and change after spinning off Bell Labs, someone at Ma Bell is still keeping the spirit of innovation alive.</p>

It's 21 chapters based on a government-funded university project, but don't let that fool you ;-): it's by far the most comprehensive work I've seen on online captioning.</p>

<p>I find myself doing more and more projects that call for advanced multimedia: audio, Flash, video and the like, as opposed to the more ordinary text + graphics. At the same time, many of my employer's clients are either in the financial industry or serve various government institutions &#8212; the sorts of clients for whom meeting accessiblity guidelines are a matter of law. Joe's work in this area will be a tremendous resource for me in the months to come. </p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/" title="Eric Meyer's site">Eric Meyer</a> and WaSP <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/" title="Douglas Bowman's site">Douglas Bowman</a> have teamed up to develop a technique for creating multiple columns of equal height and variable width using CSS. </p>

<p>Eric's <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/03/sliding-faux-columns/" title="Eric Meyer's discussion of liquid CSS columns">discussion</a> also includes his thoughts on the expediency of the odd layout table, while Doug frames his <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2004/09/03/liquid-bleach.html" title="Douglas Bowman's post on liquid CSS columns">explanation</a> in a discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of liquid design.</p>

<p>Both are must-reads.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Update: </strong>WaSP <a href="http://webstandards.org/about/bios/mholzschlag.html" title="Molly Holzschlag's WaSP bio">Molly Holzschlag</a> has <a href="http://www.molly.com/2004/09/05/faux-tables/" title="Molly Holzschlag's post on CSS-based, equal-height liquid columns">posted</a> her thoughts on the technique and the use of <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s in such circumstances. Her verdict: sometimes you just can't beat a lightweight <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>She's got a point. Sometimes <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s do just behave better. Lately I've mostly been marking-up designs done by others, and thoes others are firmly in the fixed-width camp, so I haven't had to worry so much about liquid columns. My problems tend to be vertical alignment: getting the tops &#8212; or worse yet, the <em>bottoms</em> &#8212; of variable-height elements to line up evenly. Perhaps I lack imagination, but I've not found any good way to do it. One can set a height for the elements that one <em>hopes</em> is enough to accommodate all the content, but one extra line of text and the whole thing goes bork. </p>

<p>Personally, I'm with Eric: the lack of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0803827113/" >grid-based</a> layout system in CSS is a head-slapper, what-were-they-thinking omission. It's the elephant in the corner when discussing the relative merits of <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s vs. CSS for layout. The CSS2 table-layout properties would more or less mitigate the problem, I suppose. But with IE 5 Mac &amp; Win still about in appreciable numbers, table-layout just isn't practical for most sites (yet).</p>

<p>Until it is, or until something better comes along, I fear the odd layout <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> will continue creeping into web designs. And semantics and separation of style and structure will continue to suffer.</p>
