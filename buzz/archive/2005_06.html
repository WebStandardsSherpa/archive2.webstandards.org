                                <p>A few weeks ago, Apple announced that it was making WebKit, WebCore, and JavaScriptCore open source (and got contributions within the first few hours!).</p>

<p>Correspondingly, Dave Hyatt's blog, Surfin' Safari, has now moved from <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/" title="at mozillazine.org">here</a> to <a href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/blog/" title="at webkit.opendarwin.org">here</a>. What's cool is that the whole Safari dev team is joining in, so it's not just Dave any more.</p>

                                <p>In the wake of the <a href="http://www.atmedia2005.co.uk/" title="@media 2005 web site">@media 2005 Conference</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2005/06/f2f-agenda.html" title="WCAG face to face agenda">WCAG Working Group face-to-face</a> in Brussels, accessibility has been getting a lot of attention. Lots of people have been asking good questions. Fewer have been providing good answers, but at least we're getting healthy, broad-based discussion of the issues.</p>

<p>Case in point: the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> Working Group recently <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/06/14-wai-wcag-minutes.html#item02" title="Minutes of the WCAG face to face in Brussles">moved</a> the validity guideline in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" title="WCAG 2.0 working draft">WCAG 2</a> from Level 1 to Level 2 and added a 'get out' clause. <a href="http://juicystudio.com/" title="Gez Lemon's Juicy Studio site">Gez Lemon</a> has weighed in with a thoughtful <a href="http://juicystudio.com/article/validity-accessibility.php" title="Gez Lemon's post criticizing the WCAG WG resolution moving validity to Level 2">post</a> criticizing the decision as a step backwards, effectively giving license to perpetuate the sloppy-markup sins of the past. On the other side, <a href="http://www.bestkungfu.com/" title="Matt May's site">Matt May</a> has <a href="http://www.bestkungfu.com/archive/date/2005/06/a-principled-argument/" title="Matt May's argument in favor of moving the validity requirement to Level 2 of the WCAG">argued</a> that the decision is a practical necessity in a world of authoring tools and <abbr title="Content Management Systems">CMS</abbr>es that resolutely churn out invalid markup.<br />
</p>
                        <p>Truth to tell, I can see both sides of this one. On the one hand, the value of a solid foundation upon which to build is undeniable. As <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/" title="Eric Meyer's personal site">Eric Meyer</a> has <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2005/06/16/liberal-vs-conservative/" title="Eric Meyer's discussion of the value of strict adherence to specifications">argued</a>, being too accepting of deviance from published standards creates its own set of problems, including security holes and a lack of testability. If we can't even agree upon basic technical requirements, how on earth are we to achieve &mdash; let alone evaluate compliance with &mdash; any sort of consensus on the really hard stuff?</p>

<p>On the other hand, it's absolutely true that as things stand today, validity <em>can</em> be more an ideal than a practical reality. I struggle with this daily while working for a company that has invested heavily in Microsoft's ASP.NET 1.1. As it stands, making ASP.NET churn out valid markup requires unending vigilance. 2.0 promises to change that, but it's not out of beta yet and I've got sites to get up <em>now</em>. As well, changing <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommendations has become a slow, tedious process. The current crop lag well behind advances in scripting techniques, our understanding of web site accessibility and so on. Taking a pragmatic approach to validity seems a virtual necessity for both present-day realities and future innovation.</p>

<p>There is, however, a red herring in this debate: Matt argues that because the WCAG are often used as the basis of accessibility legislation, requiring validity would make criminals of anyone who happened to forget a <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> or left a stray <code>topmargin</code> on some legacy document. This is an error of the third kind: identifying the wrong problem. Matt is arguing against legislation that doesn't take practical reality into account. That's an issue to be dealt with in the legislatures passing the laws, not in the WCAG. Legal systems the world over have ways of moderating poorly-written legislation, whether it be the famous 'one time exceptions' made by German Beamten or the discretion of U.S. judges. Rendering the WCAG toothless out of fear of some hypothetical authoritarian regulation is as unnecessary as it is futile. These are <em>guidelines</em>, not laws. The WCAG WG is not a representative legislature, its members not legislators and the WCAG themselves not legsislation. They need not &mdash; indeed should not &mdash; be written as though they were.</p>

<p>Moreover, the argument echoes WaSP <a href="http://webstandards.org/about/bios/malarkey.html" title="Andy Clarke's WaSP bio">Andy Clarke's</a> discussion of the <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/accessibility_and_a_society_of_control.html" title="Andy Clarke's argument against accessibility legislation">wisdom of legislating accessibility</a>. That's a different debate. Andy cites Michel Focault's argument that a society with too much regulation results in an ill-behaving populace. Perhaps, but I see his Focault and raise him a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_de_Maistre" title="Wikipedia article on Joseph de Maistre">Joseph de Maistre</a>: behind every stable and peaceful social order stands the shadow of the executioner. As much as we might like to believe otherwise, some significant portion of society will always act in an anti-social way unless they've got a figurative gun pointed at their heads. cf. spam, spyware and viruses.</p>

<p>In the end, it's about balancing flexibility and freedom with order and control. I don't yet know where the right balance lies with respect to validity and accessibility, but I do know I'm glad we're having this debate.</p>

                                <p>It's not even two days since WaSP announced the formation of the Accessibility Task Force, quickly coined the &ldquo;ATF&rdquo; by several folks despite a more sobering U.S. federal agency that goes by the same initialism (or would that be acronym?).  </p>

<p>While clearly a long time coming, the immediacy and detailed response to the formation of this WaSP task force proves its timeliness and need.</p>

<p>I present to you our first exhibit, &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.fawny.org/2005/06/25/atf/">ATF: Not Alcohol, Tobacco, or Firearms</a>&rdquo; by Joe Clark who provides a very comprehensive list about where he feels our efforts and energy should (and perhaps should not) go. </p>

<p>He's got many great points in the article, I especially am interested in his advocacy regarding the testing of CSS layouts. Many of us, myself included, have made the mistake that a CSS layout is more accessible by default. While certainly a step in the right direction, just creating a site using CSS does not an accessible site make.</p>

<p>As a second exhibit, our own Andy Clarke has <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/web_standards_project_wasp_accessibility_task_force.html">posted the announcement to his personal site</a> and the responses have been in most cases very positive and often very specific in detail.</p>

<p>Clearly, the WaSP ATF has lots of work ahead. While the road not yet traveled appears somewhat bleary, smoky and a bit dangerous, it's a great comfort to know how much support we have. This is true both in terms of the new members of WaSP and the ATF but also from you, our community at large, as we work together to improve Web standards implementation and methodologies worldwide.  </p>

                                <p><a href="http://opera.com/">Opera Software</a> plans to use the <a href="http://webstandards.org/acid2/">acid2 test</a> not only to improve implementation and correct bugs within the desktop browser, but then do so for its mobile browsers, too.</p>

<p><a href="http://opera.com/company/about/executives/">Jon S. von Tetzchner</a>, co-founder and CEO of Opera Software, writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When our rendering engine gets it right, you can expect to see the smiley face on handheld devices and home media terminals as well.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Opera Software's advancing influence in the mobile space means a very good future for the implementation of Web standards within mobile phones and related devices.</p>

<p>For more information on Opera's progress with the acid2 test, please see the <a href="http://my.opera.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=91018)">acid2 progress thread</a> on the My Opera Forums.

<p>Despite some <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/12/1555240" title="Slashdot story on cooperation (or lack thereof) between the Safari and KHTML teams">recent controversy</a>, Konqueror developers were able to use about half of Safari driver Dave Hyatt's <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html#008042" title="Dave Hyatt's post on Safari passing Acid2">Acid2 efforts</a> to boostrap their own <a href="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/view/1129" title="Carewolf post regarding Konqueror passing Acid2">successful Acid2 campaign</a>.</p>

<p>Some great work by the Konqueror team, but the big story is none-more-dark-horse iCab's <a href="http://frederic.bezies.free.fr/blog/index.php?2005/05/22/24-acid2-icab-le-premier-vainqueur" title="Frederic Bezies' post on iCab passing Acid2">stunning second-place finish</a> (<a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffrederic.bezies.free.fr%2Fblog%2Findex.php%3F2005%2F05%2F22%2F24-acid2-icab-le-premier-vainqueur&amp;lp=fr_en" title="Babelfish translation of Frederic Bezies' post">english translation</a>) in the Acid2 race. A truly brilliant performance by the best little browser you probably never heard of.</p>

<p>With heavyweights Explorer, Firefox and Opera distracted by things like security and release schedules, the lesser-known browsers have shown their quality. But the real winners here are end users: the more browsers cross the finish line with Acid2, the easier it will be for web developers to support even niche browsers with rich presentation and the more viable browser choices end users will have.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/campaign/edutf/">WaSP Education Task Force</a> asked Jonathan Linczak, webmaster and project lead, about the conversion of <a href="http://www.hiram.edu/">Hiram College</a> to a standards-compliant website. Jon had been reading about and using standards on sites he had developed before he landed the job opportunity at the college. He felt conversion to standards was the best way to go.</p>
