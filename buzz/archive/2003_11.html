Some of the designs are pretty cool, my personal favorite, <a href="http://www.builtforthefuture.com/reuseit/entries/redux_reuseit_minimal_jakob/">Minimal Jakob</a>, ranked in the top ten.

                                <blockquote>
<p>Do you ever come to the point sometimes when you are designing and the design is just simply not working so you begin to wonder why you are even a designer or could even claim to be one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So speaks Paul Scrivens of <a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="">9rules</a>. If you've ever felt the same (and who hasn't) a visit to his <a href="http://www.9rules.com/cssvault/" title="">CSS Vault</a> might be what's required to get the juices flowing and restore a little va-va-voom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a place where I could look at a list of sites that would inspire my creativity with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. I needed a site that linked to all the great <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> resources out there on the web. I couldn't find a site that combined those two elements, so I created one myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Partially inspired by the wunderkids of <a href="http://www.37signals.com/" title="">37signals</a>, the CSS Vault offers up an excellent collection of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> sites and resources for your delectation.</p>

<p>Although the doors have only been open for a month there's already an impressive hit-list in the gallery, and around seventy tricks, hacks, demos and articles in the resource section.</p>

<p>So, comb your hair, put on some pants, and mosey on down to the CSS Vault. It's saved at least one designer from gloom, who knows what it can do for you...</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.joeclark.org/">Joe Clark</a> writes in A List Apart that <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/saveaccessibility/">web accessibility is under threat from its own guidelines</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An upcoming revision to the Web Accessibility Guidelines is in danger of becoming unrealistically divorced from real-world web development, yielding guidelines that are at once too vague and too specific. Your expertise and input can help create realistic guidelines that work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this piece Joe runs through his issues with the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> 2.0 guidelines - currently a 14,000 word document if you exclude markup examples which makes the prospect of reading it akin to 'an anaconda trying to swallow a Range Rover'. </p>
<p>It is true to say that Joe has something of a love/hate relationship with the various <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr> groups, but it is also true to say that there are few things less pleasurable than reading through the accessibility documentation, be that version 1.0 or 2.0. Explaining what these documents mean to people new to the topic of web accessibility invariably involves <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/">dumbing them down to the bare minimum</a> and thus losing the fine points that members of the working group have worked long and hard to get incorporated in the first place. Or, alternatively, you scare them off entirely by insisting that they read the whole lot (which they won't).</p>
<p>Having attended a face-to-face meeting of the working group, I have seen first-hand how difficult it is to progress the documentation and to get consensus on key points - and this is in a controlled forum where you can get answers instantly from the people directly in charge of the documentation's direction. I came away with a feeling that to be a full-time working group participant would take a <em>lot</em> of my free time, and I really didn't think I could realistically offer the commitment that it deserves. However, like Joe, I do believe that it's important that anyone with an interest in accessibility and a little free time  looks at the issue and contributes where they can - <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/saveaccessibility/#contribute">Joe lists the many ways at the foot of his article</a>.</p>

                                <p>Locking users into a specific browser is <em>soooo</em> 1998.</p>

<p>In an otherwise insightful <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/features/feature_2003-11.shtml" title="User Interface Design for Web Applications">new article</a> by Jean Tillman of Unisys (the company that brought you the now-expired GIF patent, for those keeping notes), it's argued that those building web-based applications may wish to take advantage of browser-specific technology:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.digital-web.com/features/feature_2003-11.shtml"><p>Designers of Web-based applications, however, may have more control over the target environment, depending on the situation.  They can specify a required browser, much like they specify the required hardware or operating system environment. This gives them more freedom of design and more choices for implementing browser-specific capabilities.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Somebody get this lady a copy of <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/" title="zeldman.com: Designing With Web Standards"><abbr title="Designing With Web Standards">DWWS</abbr></a>, stat!</p>

<p>Even in a closed environment like a company with a well-employed IT department or an educational facility, relying on a particular browser/operating system setup demonstrates a lack of foresight that's best left behind in the dot-com era. Even if absolutely everyone runs that particular combo today, what about next year? Three years from now? Ten years?</p>

<p>If we learned anything from the Year 2000 bug, it's this: software lives long past its expiration date. Assuming that an application will be continually upgraded to run on current technology is na&#239;ve at best. Locking an organization in to a certain browser is dangerous; don't do it.</p>

                                <p>Now that <em>is</em> a question. Specifically, I'm referring to the use of <a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=CssHacks"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> hacks</a>,  tricks that take advantage of known browser bugs to do such
things as hiding troublesome <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> from specific browsers but not for others. Some markup purists believe them to be as evil as mal-formed <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> or invalid <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, that they are to be avoided at all costs because it's only a metter of time before a new browser comes out that doesn't behave as you'd expect and consequently renders your CSS-hacked site in a less than desirable way. </p>
<p>However, in the strive for total purity of CSS, in order to stick <em>only</em> to those properties that are known to work consistently in all browsers, we'd all be left with dull-looking, carbon-copy sites that might have some nicely styled text and background colors, but little in the way of innovative layout. At least that's my opinion. And so laying my cards on the table, I thought I should mention that fellow <acronym title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</acronym> Mark Pilgrim has a bunch of new <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/11/12/safari">CSS Hacks for Safari 1.1</a> (which is currently <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2003_10.html#a000231">only available if you upgrade to OS X 10.3</a>, but that's another matter) for you to try out.</p>
<p>Handle with care.</p>

                                <p>Apparently (and thankfully) swayed by the <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2003_10.html#a000237"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>'s impassioned appeal</a>, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has agreed to <a title="CNET News: Patent office to re-examine Eolas patent" href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5106129.html">reexamine the validity of the Eolas patent</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5106129.html">
	<p>&ldquo;A substantial outcry from a widespread segment of the affected industry has essentially raised a question of patentability with respect to the 906 patent claims,&rdquo; Stephen Kunin, the <abbr title="United States Patent and Trademark Office">USPTO</abbr>'s deputy commissioner for patent examination policy, wrote in his order for re-examination. &ldquo;This creates an extraordinary situation for which a director-ordered examination is an appropriate remedy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the <abbr title="United States Patent and Trademark Office">USPTO</abbr> has indeed made a promising move, it is only the first in the involved <a title="Reexamination - How does a bad patent get invalidated?" href="http://www.baypatents.com/reexam.asp">patent reexamination process</a>. Given the sweeping <a title="Web Standards Project: Click Here, You Idiot" href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2003_10.html#a000215">changes the Eolas patent could inflict upon the Web</a> as we know it, we can only hope that the end result is the right one for web standards.</p>

                                <p>
No matter how hard we try, there will always be web sites that refuse to validate, don't want to play ball where it comes to accessibility and laugh in the face of table-free <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> layouts - and mostly these sites are the type that are generated dynamically (be that a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> solution, an e-commerce site or a user-driven forum). Today I spotted an email which I felt compelled to follow up on though - it was regarding an e-commerce shopping cart service that claimed it could achieve AAA Bobby compliance, validate as <abbr title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> Transitional and would generate pages that are table-free (unless there is <em>real</em> tabular data). "Ahh, heard that one before," I thought, and picked up the phone to speak to 'one of their tech guys' to grill him a bit more. What I heard from the other end of the line, though, was <em>very</em> encouraging, so I'll paraphrase here:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Inspired by CSS Zen garden ... cannot change underlying XHTML but we provide hooks for CSS manpulation, like the zen garden ... not <em>enforcing</em> table-based designs because we appreciate that not all developers understand how to do this ... the Doug Bowman sliding doors method [used in one template] ... using the @import statement to split styles between basic and advanced ... the Zeldman method ... AAA compliant except for pages with forms because of the deault placeholder text ..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the kind of 'marketese' I'm used to hearing, and for a change it felt goooood. The site/service in question is called <a href="http://www.karova.com/General/corporate/default.htm">Karova</a>, and will be premiered at the <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/xpedio/groups/public/documents/code/public_rnib004057.hcsp">Techshare 2003 conference</a> in Birmingham, <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>, and I'll be watching this one with interest.</p>

                                <p>Fellow WaSP Ethan Marcotte has stumbled across a <a href="http://www.sidesh0w.com/weblog/2003/11/06/multiple_installations_of_windows_internet_explorer.html">gem of a find</a> &#8212; turning Microsoft's recent patent headache into an opportunity, a clever Chicagoan designer has discovered that the new '<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/" title="Information for Developers about Changes to Internet Explorer">patent-friendly</a>' version of IE highlights a hole that allows the simultaneous install of IE5.01, IE5.5, and IE6.0 all on the same Windows machine.</p>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.insert-title.com/web_design/?page=articles/dev/multi_IE"> Joe Maddalone's tutorial</a> to set this up on your own system. The instructions are simple enough to cause <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/007561" title="A designer makes IE developer friendly">wondering</a> whether Microsoft has held back this information for the past five years, and why. We don't know, perhaps Microsoft themselves can clear this up for us.</p>
