                                <p>Word comes in from <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2004/02.html#d25">Tantek &Ccedil;elik</a> that the CSS Working Group has been busy. The past few days have seen the publication of the following goodies:</p>

<ul title="Recent CSS-related W3C Publications">
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/">CSS 2.1 Candidate Recommendation</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Of particular interest is the new &#8216;reader&#8217; media type, built with screenreaders in mind. Those keeping tabs on the development of image replacement techniques may recall Joe Clark's edifying article on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fir/">A List Apart</a> last year which highlighted access problems with <acronym title="Fahrner Image Replacement">FIR</acronym>, and perhaps even his <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2003Oct/0328.html">proposal of a new media type</a> around that time. The investigation and follow-up discussion has begun to bear fruit; well done, Joe.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the Working Group for this milestone. (Feedback may be directed to the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">www-style mailing list</a>.)</p>

<p>The online service validates XForms documents by URL, file upload and text area input options are coming soon. If an XForms document is not available, the site provides several XForm sample documents to try and an XForms Bookmarklet will allow users to validate from their own browser.</p>

                                <p>We've had the ability to add navigation options via the <code>link</code> element for accessibility purposes for some time now. But as with so much of what ails, user agent adoption has been slow in coming, especially for Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Users of Mozilla may already be familiar with the Site Navigation Bar, which can be set to appear when additional <code>link</code> related options are available. What's interesting to me is how quickly I became dependent on this toolbar! It's clear that many users who don't need the accessibility assistance will also benefit from having navigation options via the browser, enhancing the user experience of those web sites using <code>link</code> for accessible navigation.</p>

<p>But for users of IE, this feature has never been available, until now. Thanks to Thomas J. Gritzan, folks using IE for Windows can download the free  <a href="http://www.draig.de/LinkBar/index.en.html" title="read more and download the link navigation toolbar for internet explorer"><code>&lt;link&gt;</code> Navigation Toolbar</a>. It's easy to install and even comes with some unusual, useful extras such as a pop-up blocker and a Google search bar.</p>

<p>For an excellent article by Sander Tekelenburg that describes how to use <code>link</code> for navigation, check out &ldquo;<a href="http://www.euronet.nl/~tekelenb/WWW/LINK/" title="read about link navigation">Navigating the WWW</a>&rdquo;. The article eloquently describes the challenges and working solutions related to <code>link</code> based navigation.</p>

<p>Both the toolbar and article are currently available in English and German.</p>

                                <p>Whew. We passed the XHTML validation test that <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/">Keith</a> randomly conducted. He makes a few good points about how hard it is to stay valid. When validating a page, you fix the errors encountered. Who is to say tomorrow it will validate when you slip in your blog entry or something of the sort. In reality, we strive for validated pages and like human nature, we goof. Keith does a better job of making the point. [ Via <a href="http://www.grokdotcom.com/">Grok</a>]</p>

<li>Complex table layouts don't linearize</li>
<li>Javascript navigation doesn't work without Javascript</li>
<li>Form elements must be clearly labeled</li>
<li>Non-scalable text is unreadable</li>
<li>Frames with useless names ("Left", "Spacer Right", "Top" etc) are, well, useless</li>

<p>To be fair, only seven sites were declared completely inaccessible; most of the sites were merely <q>very hard to use</q>.</p>

                                <p>Great Britain, while famous for many things, is perhaps best known for the efficiency and promptness with which it runs its rail systems.</p>

<p>Each day millions of citizens are transported in comfort and style from the doorsteps of their homes, to offices, schools, shopping centres, and any number of other destinations.</p>

<p>It's travel nirvana.</p>

<p>However &#8212; and I'm loath to sully the name of UK transport like this, but the truth must out &#8212; this beautiful and admired system has one small flaw: the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/planmyjourney/">National Rail Enquiries web site</a>.</p>

<p>Javascript, cookies, and the ability to see iframes are just some of the barriers placed in front of users of this service. Yes, people are being denied the pleasure of interacting with UK rail transport, and it makes my blood boil.</p>

<p>Matthew Somerville was similarly incensed and as a consequence has taken the time to produce an <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/railway/timetable/" title="View this accessible redesign">accessible version of the train timetable</a>. This, along with accessible versions of six other sites (<a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/railway/" title="View this accessible redesign">Live Rail Departure Boards</a>, <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/odeon/" title="View this accessible redesign">Odeon Cinemas</a>, <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/hutton/" title="View this accessible redesign">the Hutton Inquiry</a>, <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/web/accessibility/bbcnews/" title="View this accessible redesign">the BBC</a>, <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/192/" title="View this accessible redesign">Directory Enquiries</a>, and a <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/web/accessibility/comicshoplocator/" title="View this accessible redesign">Comic Shop Locator</a>) show that there really is no need to employ such exclusive design strategies.</p>

<p>You can see, and use, all of Matthew's redesigns at <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/web/accessibility/">www.dracos.co.uk/web/accessibility/</a>.</p>

                                <p>Businesses are missing a large audience by <a href="http://www.internet-magazine.com/news/view.asp?id=3913">failing to make their Web sites accessible</a>. A Nomensa FTSE report finds that 79 percent of the Web sites did not provide alternate text for images, 56 percent did not have useful alternate text, and 77 percent did not allow the font size to be rescaled. </p>

<p>I believe this is accurate based on my recent experience of judging Web sites to determine whether or not they should be considered for a nomination based on their quality.</p>

                                <p><cite>Anders Jacobsen</cite> points out that Orkut, the latest in a seemingly endless string of social networking clones, <a href="http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/archives/2004/02/03/orkut_usability_or_not.html">fails the most basic accessibility requirement</a>: <code>ALT</code> attributes on images.  Specifically, the images that you select to accept or reject someone as your friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>So-and-so added you as a friend.
Is So-and-so your friend?
[LINK] [LINK]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Update: Apparently Orkut also uses CAPTCHA images on registration -- images of words distorted to make them difficult to read by computer programs.  CAPTCHA images have their supporters; their aim is to make the system more useful overall by preventing spammers from auto-registering thousands of accounts.  But thought needs to be put into such a system to make sure it is accessible to as many people as possible.  One technique is to provide a link to a music file where the user could type the word they hear.  Neither technique satisfies everyone, but the combination of techniques vastly reduces the number of people being discriminated against.</p>

<p>None of the debate over CAPTCHA has any bearing on the original report, though.  The lack of ALT attributes on "Yes" and "No" buttons is simply inexcusable.</p>
