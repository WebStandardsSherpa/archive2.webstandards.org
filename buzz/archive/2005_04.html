                                <p>Yesterday Dave Hyatt posted news that Safari now <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html#008042">passes</a> the <a href="../../act/acid2/index.html">Acid2 test</a>, making it the first browser to do so.</p>
<p>Patches to enable Acid2 related support have been made available in Hyatt&rsquo;s announce post, linked above.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, I thought it would be unfair to simply announce the news, so I sent off a few questions and received the following in reply.</p>
<blockquote><h4>BH: When will the patches you released yesterday be merged into a general release?</h4>
<p><b>DH:</b> I&rsquo;m sorry, but I really couldn&rsquo; even guess.  At the moment we&rsquo;re just concentrating on an update that fixes regressions/crashes.  I don&rsquo;t know yet what the update situation is going to be like.</p>
<h4>BH: Do you expect that the Konqueror team will merge your changes into their product anytime soon?</h4>
<p><b>DH:</b> Yes, they expressed interest already in seeing the patches.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if theirs is the first browser to ship a version that passes the test.  <code>:)</code></p>
<h4>BH:  Looking at the Acid2 test from a software engineer&rsquo;s perspective, what were your biggest challenges in getting Safari to pass?</h4>
<p><b>DH:</b>  Well, the great thing about KHTML is that nothing in the test was that hard to implement.  Safari was actually already really close (despite the rendering in 1.3).  The bugs were either just missing minor features, like <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> support and <code>min-/max- -width/-height</code> on positioned elements, or minor details, such as slightly better handling of percentage values that end up not being used.</p>
<h4>BH: More broadly, what are the biggest engineering challenges you see with moving onto CSS3 support in future browsers?</h4>
<p><b>DH:</b>  I think doing vertical text could be incredibly difficult, since KHTML is not designed for that at all.</p>
<h4>BH:  How useful is the feedback you&rsquo;ve gotten from web developers and Safari end users, and how can that feedback be made still more useful?</h4>
<p><b>DH:</b>  ...Immensely useful.  Web developers catch some of the most important bugs and write very clear and concise reductions of the problems.  That makes the bugs really easy to fix quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>We want to extend a thank-you to Hyatt and the Safari team for jumping on the test so quickly, and another to the web developers who have helped to make this first success happen.</p>

                                <p><abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> team member Chris Wilson has posted about a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/22/410963.aspx" title="Chris Wilson's post on progress on IE 7">couple of new developments</a> in IE7: support for alpha-transparent PNG images and fixing a few of the bizarre float-related rendering bugs in Trident, the rendering engine used in IE 4+ for Windows.</p>

<p>It's a good start, and happily puts to rest persistent rumors that IE7 would be strictly a security-and-<abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>-features release. Yea Chris Wilson!</p>

The <a href="http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/pdfs/AdobeMacromediaFAQ.pdf" title="FAQ on Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia in PDF format">FAQ</a> (PDF) on the acquisition has this to say:</p><blockquote><p><strong>How does this affect Adobe's support of SVG (scalable vector graphics)?</strong></p>

<p>Both Adobe and Macromedia have been involved in defining SVG and both were part of the W3C working group that defined SVG. The combined company will continue to work with customers and partners to define a future roadmap for
our products.</p></blockquote>

                                <p> <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B3B04AC26%2DE1ED%2D4FA3%2D8E72%2D9C493CADC469%7D&amp;dist=rss&amp;siteid=mktw" title="Marketwatch article on Adobe's pruchase of Macromedia">Adobe's impending purchase of Macromedia</a> has fueled no end of speculation on the <a href="http://www.allinthehead.com/retro/253/end-of-the-road-for-fireworks" title="WaSP Drew McLellan's post on the fate of Macromedia Fireworks">fate of now-redundant applications</a> and hand-wringing over the <a href="http://news.com.com/Developers+react+to+Adobes+Macromedia+buy/2100-1012_3-5675449.html" title="C|Net article on developer reaction to Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia">impact of the acquisition on popular Macromedia applications</a>, not to mention the loss of competition in the space. But all that's really a sideshow. The meat of the story is what this means for what Macromedia terms 'rich internet applications', and for the future of web standards in the space.</p>
                        <p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/" title="Adobe's site">Adobe</a> has established their PostScript-based <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> as a de facto standard for creating electronic documents in situations where the mutability of HTML isn't necessarily desirable, such as when 'soft proofing' a document destined for print or when distributing documents like court decisions where textual integrity is paramaount. But there's another class of documents where Adobe hasn't been so successful: forms requiring data entry.  While PDF works well for print-and-complete style forms, Adobe hasn't had much success wooing organizations that wish to have recipients complete and submit forms online. Truth to tell, no one vendor really has &mdash; though it's not for lack of trying.</p>

<p>Pre-web, printed forms was a huge industry. Organisations required printed paper order forms, expense reports, requisition forms, employee evaluations, application forms &mdash; you name it. Supplying these forms became an industry unto itself. One of my first jobs was working with a printer who specialized in short-run jobs the giant forms printers of the day couldn't run profitably. Today those large forms printers are virtually extinct, and my <a href="http://www.genoabusforms.com/" title="Genoa Business Forms' site">former employer</a> is carrying on as a niche player. A once-proud industry has been effectively reduced to rubble, and <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> &mdash particularly the web &mdash is the reason.</p>

<p>Organizations have discovered that electronic forms save not only printing costs, but can save time and money by helping recipients enter data accurately through effective <abbr title="User Interfaces">UIs</abbr> and validation of the input. As a result, many paper forms have been converted to online applications built with everything from <a href="http://filemaker.com/" title="Filemaker site">Filemaker</a> to <a href="http://www.lotus.com/products/product4.nsf/wdocs/noteshomepage" title="Lotus Notes product home">Lotus Notes</a> to good ol' HTML.</p>

<p>'Electronic forms' are big business, and a host of companies have been fighting for a piece of it. Former forms printing heavyweight <a href="http://www.amgraf.com/" title="Form publishing software maker Amgraf's site">Amgraf</a> has been working on the market since the mid-1990s. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" title="Microsoft's site">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" title="Microsoft Office product home">Office</a> applications, particularly <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010858001033.aspx" title="Microsoft Excel product home">Excel</a>, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857911033.aspx" title="Microsoft Access product home">Access</a>, <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857931033.aspx" title="Microsoft Outlook product home">Outlook</a> and <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857991033.aspx" title="Microsoft Word product home">Word</a> have long been de facto players in this space, and more recently Microsoft have addressed the problem specifically with <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857921033.aspx" title="Microsoft InfoPath product home">InfoPath</a>. The <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/" title="xForms home page">xForms</a> targets this space too, as does <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/" title="WHAT WG's site">WHATWG</a>'s <a href="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/" title="Web Forms 2.0 specification">Web Forms 2.0</a>. But the most widely-used solution is good old HTML.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/" title="Macromedia site">Macromedia</a> has come at the space from the other direction. Their <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/" title="Flash product home">Flash</a> technology has grown from an animation and vector illustration format into a technology for developing sophisticated <abbr title="Graphical User Interfaces">GUIs</abbr>. Here, they compete with the likes of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla Foundation site">Mozilla Foundation</a>'s <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/" title="XUL home page">XUL</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xbl/xbl.html" title="XBL home">XBL</a>, <a href="http://www.sun.com/" title="Sun Microsystems site">Sun Microsystems</a>' <a href="http://java.sun.com/" title="Java home">Java</a> and Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/smartclient/community/wffaq/default.aspx" title="Windows Forms FAQ">Windows Forms</a>. Other players include WHATWG's <a href="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/" title="Web Applications 1.0 specification">Web Applications 1.0</a> and <a href="http://whatwg.org/specs/web-controls/current-work/" title="Web Controls 1.0">Web Controls 1.0</a>, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/" title="SVG home">SVG</a> and soon Microsoft's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnintlong/html/longhornch03.asp" title="MSDN article on XAML">XAML</a>. Recently, the-technologies-formerly-known-as-<abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr> have also resurfaced as a viable option under the <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php" title="Adaptive Path article coining the term 'Ajax'">Ajax</a> moniker.</p>

<p>As document-centric electronic forms solutions like PDF begin to offer sophisticated UI and validation capabilities, and rich internet application technologies become easier to develop and more flexible in their presentation, the two are increasingly competing head-to-head. By acquiring Macromedia and their Flash technology, Adobe has positioned themselves on both sides of the competition with the document-centric PDF and the 'rich UI'-centric <abbr title="ShockWave Flash">SWF</abbr> It's a classic pincer maneuver, though with such heavyweights as <a href="http://www.ibm.com/" title="IBM's site">IBM</a>, Microsoft, <a href="http://www.sap.com/" title="SAP's site">SAP</a> and Sun in the middle one could be forgiven for wondering who's surrounding who.</p>

<p>From a standards perspective, both Adobe and Macromedia have pledged &mdash; and delivered &mdash; increasing levels of support for web standards in their web authoring tools (GoLive and Dreamweaver, respectively). I don't see any reason to expect that will change. Where rich UIs are concerned, however, the situation is less hopeful.</p>

<p>Adobe has long <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/" title="Adobe SVG Zone">dabbled</a> with <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>, adding SVG export to Illustrator and the ill-fated <a href="http://news.com.com/Adobe+drops+animation+software/2110-1012_3-5110599.html">LiveMotion</a> animation package as well as offering an <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/overview/whatsnew.html" title="Adobe's SVG Viewer home">SVG Viewer plug-in</a> for browsers. SVG has carved out a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile/" title="SVG mobile profiles home">solid niche</a> in the mobile space, but on the desktop Macromedia's SWF rules the roost &mdash; recent efforts to add native SVG support to <a href="http://www.opera.com/features/svg/" title="Opera's SVG page">Opera</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/svg/" title="Mozilla SVG home">Mozilla</a> notwithstanding. But as this otherwise-flawed* <a href="http://news.com.com/Macromedia%2C+Adobe+make+peace+for+bigger+fight+-+page+2/2100-1012_3-5675158-2.html" title="C|Net News.com article on Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia">C|Net article</a> points out, Adobe's previously standards-centric approach to rich internet applications is in direct competition with their newly-acquired Flash technology.</p>

<p>While I don't expect Adobe to drop SVG straightaway, if only to hedge their bets, it seems foolish to think Adobe will pursue it with anywhere near the same enthusiasm they have in the past. After all, if they had faith in the endeavor why would they bother purchasing the technology's primary competitor?</p>

<p>Right now, it's far too early to say who or what will come to dominate the <abbr title="Rich Internet Applications">RIA</abbr> space. PDF and SWF have an early lead in document-centric and presentation-centric areas. SVG is looking strong in the mobile space. Microsoft's XAML will no doubt be a strong player as well, if only due to a potential installed base rivaled only by the PDF+SWF. With IT heavyweights like IBM and SAP behind it, xForms is also hard to count out, and the most-used option at present is plain old HTML, wether enhanced by <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" title="ECMAScript specification">ECMAScript</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" title="W3C's CSS home">CSS</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/" title="W3C's DOM home">DOM</a> or not.</p>

<p>In the end, I doubt any one technology will dominate completely. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. The question is whether those left standing will be owned and controlled by one company or will be free and open. And that's a decision that will ultimately be made by end users and developers &mdash; us, in other words.</p>

<p>Interesting times indeed.</p>

<p><br /><br />* The article characterizes Adobe's <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/golive/main.html" title="GoLive product home">GoLive</a> as 'ill-fated' but supports the assertion with a link to an article announcing the discontinuation of the LiveMotion animation app. In fact, while GoLive hasn't posed much of a threat to Macromedia's <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/go/gnavtray_dwmx_home" title="Dreamweaver product home">Dreamweaver</a>, it has attracted a loyal following. As well, the article claims Macromedia introduced <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/freehand/" title="FreeHand product home">FreeHand</a> as a response to Adobe <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/main.html">Illustrator</a>, when in fact FreeHand was acquired by Macromedia in the early '90s when Adobe purchased Aldus, FreeHand's original developer.

                                <p>Those with long memories will remember ABBA. The rest of us may just about recall the good work of the CSS Samurai when they launched the Acid Test back in 1997 and challenged makers of browsers world-over to improve their support for CSS 1.</p>

<p>Well, dammit, we're at it again. No, not the Swedish song and dance routines, the bit about the browsers. <a href="../../acid2/index.html" title="Acid2">Acid2</a> is a brand new test designed to push the limits of HTML, CSS, and PNG support in browsers and authoring tools. By testing against Acid2, flaws in support for common web standards are quickly and easily exposed.</p>

<p>Read the official <a href="../../press/releases/archive/2005/04/13/index-2.html" title="Acid2 Press Release">press release</a> for the full skinny. I promise it has no mention of camptastic European supergroups.</p>

<p>Early feedback is coming in from the likes of Safari developer Dave Hyatt over at Apple. In his <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html#007932" title="Surfin Safari">blog entry on the subject</a>, Dave states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I started work today on making Safari pass the test, and I thought I'd blog my progress as I fix bugs in the test. This will be a fairly slow process as whole features may have to be added simply to make one row of the test render correctly.</p>
<p>For those using Safari, I have fixed two bugs so far...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's great news for Safari users, and we look forward to receiving feedback from those working on other browsers and tools in due time.</p>

To help with the change, Penn State offers up several resources including template options for content pages, tips and hints for creating accessible content, and contact methods for further help.</p>

<p>Congratulations to all those involved with the new policy changes at Penn State. You have addressed web standards and have outlined a plan for change.  </p>

                                <p>April 2, 2005 marks the one year anniversary (our <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2004_04.html#a000319" title="The Way Forward With Web Standards: A Web Standards Project Buzz">2004 Buzz</a>) of documents published by the project team at <a href="http://maccaws.org/">Making A Commercial Case for Adopting Web Standards (MACCAWS)</a>.</p> <p>The publications are part of a <a href="http://maccaws.org/kit/">Kit</a> consisting of a standards primer and a technical white paper. These documents are currently available in English and French, and are in the process of being translated into Spanish and Japanese. An Italian version will be available shortly. </p>

<p>The kit documents:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.maccaws.org/kit/primer/">What Every Web Site Owner Should Know About Standards: A Web Standards Primer</a>

   <blockquote><p> A brief non-technical explanation of Web standards for Web site owners and managers. This article explains the benefits of Web standards, how they work, and how to begin implementing them.</p></blockquote></li>

<li><a href="http://www.maccaws.org/kit/way-forward/">The Way Forward with Web Standards</a>

    <blockquote><p>The MACCAWS white paper on Web standards. This article assembles arguments and information about Web standards into one document and explains Web standards in terms of how they affect business.</p></blockquote></li></ul>

                                <p>There are a couple of new WaSPs trying out their wings. As mentioned in a previous post, there are actually <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2005_03.html#a000507">quite a few things happening in the background with the Web Standards Project</a>, and for that we need committed and skilled people. Two such people are <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke (aka Stuff and Nonsense/All That Malarkey)</a> and <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/">Dean Edwards</a> (who <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/">came up with an <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 7</a> while Microsoft were happily taking a rest on their proverbial laurels). As fellow Brits (I confess, I had no idea Dean was a Londoner!) it's a pleasure to officially welcome them to the fold and I know that I speak for all the other WaSPs when I say that I'm looking forward to working with them on our happy little cause. </p>
