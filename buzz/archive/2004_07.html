                                <p>It doesn't have the cryptic appeal of 'Frodo Lives!' scrawled on a subway station wall, but it does have the advantage of being <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/28/1218202&amp;tid=114&amp;tid=218" title="slashdot article about the impending release of Netscape 7.2">true</a>: an updated version of Netscape &#8212; version 7.2 &#8212; is due on <a href="http://www.netscapestore.com/products/software" title="Official Netscape 7.2 release announcement">August 3<sup>rd</sup></a>. </p>

<p>Based on <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/" title="Mozilla 1.7 download page">version 1.7 of the Mozilla suite</a>, Netscape 7.2 won't be a quantum leap over the current version (<a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/default.jsp" title="Netscape 7.1 download page">7.1</a>, based on Mozilla 1.4), but should nevertheless offer a worthwhile boost in speed, stability and standards-compliant rendering goodness.</p>

                                <p>Fellow WaSP <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/bios/dbowman.html" title="Douglas Bowman's WaSP bio">Douglas Bowman</a> has posted a <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/articles/throwing_tables/" title="Douglas Bowman's tabelless design analysis">analysis</a> of the benefits of tableless design. It's based on his presentation at <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/digitaldesignworld/Seattle/" title="Digital Design World Seattle site">Digital Design World</a> in which he made-over <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/" title="Microsoft's site">Microsoft's</a> home page using only CSS for layout.</p>

<p>What's makes this post especially interesting is Bowman's focus on real-world business benefits:</p>

<blockquote><p>I thought it was worth pointing out that it's now very possible to demonstrate and walk through how they &#8212; or any company &#8212; could create one super-powered version that uses leaner markup, works in more browsers, and increases accessibility. All demonstrated within the time span of an hour or two&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Inspired by the <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2004_07.html#a000374" title="Buzz post about Odeon threatening an accessiblity advocate with legal action">Odeon debacle</a>, former WaSP extraordinaire <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman's site">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> holds forth on <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0704d.shtml" title="Jeffrey Zeldman on the value of good samaritanism">the value of good samaritans</a> who build accessible, standards-compliant versions of popular web sites for free.</p>

<p>Zeldman also gives an excellent analysis of the accessibility and usability problems with Odeon's <a href="http://www.odeon.co.uk/" title="Odeon Cinemas' site">official site</a> and how samaritan <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/" title="Matthew Somerville's site">Matthew Somerville</a> addressed them.</p>

<p>I find Herr Zeldman's explanation of Odeon's stance somewhat less persuasive, however. The thrust of his argument is that it wasn't that the 'business dweebs' were 'clueless', but that the powers-that-be at Odeon had no contract with Mr. Somerville, and therefore no assurance as to the real quality of the work, who actually owned the code and other issues that cause hair loss amongst the pinstripes-and-wingtips set. It's all an exercise in <abbr title="Covering Your Ass">CYA</abbr>, in other words.</p>

<p>Well, duh. Of course that's part of the problem. But don't you suppose Odeon could have set their legal beagles to drafting a contract covering those points for Mr. Somerville to autograph, rather than having them fire off a boilerplate cease-and-desist? And if the problem is, as Jeffrey says, that the marketroids responsible for the site are unable to evaluate the quality of Mr. Somerville's work, then isn't that a case of, uh, 'clueless business dweebs'? Is looking at the traffic numbers and the feedback emails really so much to ask?</p>

<p>More likely, the idea that a single individual could do better a the firm they paid six figures just set up too much cognitive dissonance for Odeon's management to handle. Besides, they're trying to <a href="http://uk.biz.yahoo.com/040702/80/ex8cu.html" title="Article on the proposed sale of Odeon Cinemas">sell the company</a>. How good a buy is it if management is spending six figures for tasks that could be accomplished by one guy in his spare time?</p>

<p>This is where we come right back to 'clueless business dweebs.' The thing is, what Mr. Somerville did was, in many ways, the <em>easy</em> part. Making that nice, accessible front end work smoothly with all the back-end voodoo required of an ecommerce site like Odeon's is far more challenging than it might seem at first (you'll note that Mr. Somerville's version didn't allow ticket sales directly, so he hadn't done all the integration work). Ditto the creative work in conceiving and executing a design that supports Odeon's brand (though in this case, one might argue that they didn't get their money's worth there, either). And then one must make the back-end of the web site talk to Odeon's legacy systems. </p>

<p>The reality is that there's a reason for hiring those expensive firms: they have the in-house expertise to do far more than just make an accessible front end. And that expertise is expensive. The problem is that, like as not, the 'suits' know nothing of all that complexity. All they know is what they see on their PC, and what they see is the front end. To them, it probably did seem that Somerville was making their decision to hire the firm they did look far more foolish than it really was. Nobody likes to look foolish. Highly-paid executives least of all. And admitting they, with their six- or seven-figure salaries, had overlooked flaws that some maths major could both identify and fix in his spare time would have made them look exactly that.</p>

<p>I'm not privvy to the discussions that go on in Odeon's executive suite, so I have no way of knowing the real reason for their change of heart regarding Mr. Somerville's effort. Nonetheless, if I were to speculate, I would say it's a case of corporate denial. Their organizational knowledge regading the web was all wrong, and wrong in ways that aren't expensive or difficult to correct. But rather than admit that and cut their losses, they'd rather hire another six-figure-fee firm to tell them what they (now) already know. That way, they can pretend that they didn't overlook the obvious, but were instead a victim of arcane forces knowable only to highly-paid experts.  'DeNial' isn't just a river in Egypt.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/" title="Jon Udell's weblog">Jon Udell</a> recently <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/07/16/29FElonghornreich_1.html" title="Jon Udell's conversation with Brendan Eich and Miguel de Icaza about Microsoft's Longhorn">discussed</a> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnintlong/html/longhornch03.asp" title="MSDN page on XAML">XAML</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/01/Avalon/default.aspx" title="MSDN Magazine article on Avalon">Avalon</a>, Microsoft's next-generation <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> development technologies, with chief <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla Foundation">Mozilla</a> architect <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/" title="Brendan Eich's weblog">Brendan Eich</a> and <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/ximian.html" title="Ximian page at Novell">Ximian</a>, <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/" title="Mono project home page">Mono</a> and <a href="http://www.gnome.org/" title="GNOME project home page">GNOME</a> leader <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/activity-log.php" title="Miguel de Icaza's weblog">Miguel de Icaza</a> .</p>

<p>XAML and Avalon represent the future of Windows applications. The fact that XAML is a declarative markup language &#8212; an implementation of <abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, to be precise &#8212 has led to speculation that they represent a Microsoft attempt to control the next generation of web-based user interfaces. Certainly, XAML bears more than a passing resemblence to XML-based UI technologies such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/About" title="About SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) page at the W3C">SVG</a> + <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xbl/" title="XBL (eXtensible Binding Language) page at the W3C">XBL</a> (formerly <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG12/#rcc" title="SVG-RCC (Scalable Vector Graphics-Rendering Custom Content) page at the W3C">SVG-RCC</a>) and Mozilla's <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xul/" title="The XUL project's home page">XUL</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know whether Microsoft has any such ambitions or not. XAML could potentially be of tremendous value to those developers currently working on in-house VisualBasic apps or ActiveX controls for intranets. That alone is enough reason for Microsoft to pursue it, even if XAML never makes it onto the public web.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether XAML becomes prevalent on the public web, it's one of the techologies to watch as web apps begin moving past simple HTML UIs towards the sort of rich graphical interfaces we expect on the desktop.</p>

                                <p>While I'm quite sure this post won't be seen by the folks who most need to read it, I feel the need to speak up.</p>

<p>In a post discussing his new <a href="http://scoblerocks.blogspot.com/" title="Fan site dedicated to Robert Scoble">fan site</a>, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/07/23.html#a7993" title="Robert Scoble's post mentioning the vitriol aimed at the IE Team">Robert Scoble</a> notes the surfeit of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/07/22/191629.aspx#FeedBack" title="IE Team blog post comments displaying bad manners">vitriol</a> directed at the IE Team in the comments to their blog. Jeremy Wright says <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2004/07/23/why_bill_gates_should_never_blog.html" title="Jeremy Wright's post on the abuse the IE Team is taking">"it's worse than slashdot."</a></p>

<p>That's a shame. I know the WaSP <a href="http://webstandards.org/about/bios/" title="WaSP bios page">members</a> are above such crassness. And I'm quite sure that our friends and supporters are of similar mien. But it's apparent that some in the standards community aren't.</p>

<p>Now I'm certainly no stranger to <a href="http://webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2004_05.html#a000344" title="Buzz post in which ckaminski uses naughty words">strong language</a> or <a href="http://webstandards.org/opinion/archive/2003/06/27/" title="WaSP opinion critical of Microsoft, co-authored by ckaminski">strong opinions</a>. But there are two things I try to do, though I don't always succeed: firstly, I try to criticize the behavior, not the person. Just because someone does something I find objectionable doesn't mean they're bad or stupid. Secondly, I try to maintain a modicum of respect when I'm on someone else's site. It's one thing to give 'em hell in your own house, or even from a soapbox on a streetcorner. It's another thing to be invited into someone's living room and berate them there.</p>

<p>So on the off-chance that one of the hotheads from the IE Team blog has wandered over here, I'm asking nicely: please, knock off the abuse. We're all frustrated by IE's shortcomings, myself included (I'm typing this on a break from churning out templates on a Sunday evening; but for IE's sub-bar CSS handling I'd be home sipping a <a href="http://www.stella-artois.com/" title="Stella Artois brewery site">Stella</a> and cooking a nice dinner for my <a href="http://www.rimone.org/" title="ckaminski's SO's blog">SO</a>). Cursing and abusing the IE Team, slamming them for lack of content or critiquing the blog's markup or stylesheets isn't going to fix anything, though. More likely it'll do the exact opposite.</p>

<p>By all means be critical &#8212; they're blogging to get your feedback, after all &#8212; but criticize the product, not the people. And do it politely. Or at least civilly. </p>

                                <p>The W3C has released the sixth (that's right, sixth) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xhtml2-20040722/">draft of XHTML 2.0</a>.  Despite its draft status, the release re-ignited the ongoing <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/23/1646237&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=9">HTML vs. XHTML debate</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a simple little fact: <em>You don't have to use XHTML if you don't want to</em>! The point isn't that XHTML is wonderful and HTML isn't.  In fact, there's not a lot one can do with XHTML that one can't do with HTML if the markup is being used for structural purposes.  </p>

<p>So pick a markup language and forget the fighting, which is just a waste of your precious time. You think XHTML isn't for you? Fine!  No one's saying you have to use it.  The W3C <em>recommends</em> markup languages, it doesn't dictate  their use.  It's not like the W3C is gonna come and get you and toss you into markup prison.  It's not like you'll get stung by a WaSP or anything, especially if you're paying attention to better practices and getting as much presentation out of your documents as your situation allows.</p>

<p>The point is to author documents that are well-structured, folks, and that can be done in HTML 4.01 just as efficiently as it can in XHTML 1.0.  And leave the drafts to draft status, okay?  There's a reason they're called drafts, after all.</p>

<p>Well said. </p>

<p>Apparently Mr. Johnson thought so, too, as <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2004/07.html#d15t2116" title="Tantek post on Feedster's exclusion of IE/Mac, updated at bottom to indicate Feedster had relented">reports</a> indicate that Feedster has relented and begun accepting IE/Mac visitors again.</p>

An <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/devices/articles/msvg_t.html" title="Macromedia article explaining the decision to support SVGT">article</a> from Macromedia explaining the decison has drawn <a href="http://oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/5212" title="Antoine Quint post rebutting Macromedia's article">fire</a> from <a href="http://oreillynet.com/" title="O'Reilly Network">O'Reilly's</a> Antoine Quint for what he perceives as inaccuracies in Macromedia's article.</p>

<p>I don't know the technology well enough to know whether Quint has a point or not, and the /. thread predictably descends into mindless Flash-bashing, but the articles themselves are an interesting read.</p>

<p>It seems that while mobile networks and devices are typically locked-down by large carriers &#8212; at least when one compares them to the Internet and PCs &#8212; vector graphics is one area where the mobile arena may be more open and standards-friendly than the WWW.</p>

<p>One has to wonder: might SVG's success in the mobile space give it a second chance on the WWW? SVG hasn't gotten much traction on the Web, no doubt due in large part to the success of Macromedia's Flash. And designing for mobile devices is different enough from designing for PCs that developing a single UI for both with the same technology isn't a compelling enough proposition to start a mass migration to SVG. However, the proliferation of SVG viewers and authoring tools for mobile devices can't hurt SVG's chances of staging a comeback on the PC.</p>

<p>Here's hoping, anyway.</p>

                                <p>About a year ago, UK web accessibility activist <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/" title="Matthew Somerville's web site">Matthew Somerville</a> worked up an accessible, x-browser <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/odeon/" title="former home of the Accessible Odeon web site, now just a placeholder">version</a> of UK cinema chain <a href="http://www.odeon.co.uk/" title="Odeon's web site">Odeon's</a> web site. His work won acclaim from such disparate sources as the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,1008868,00.html" title="Guardian article which discusses Accessible Odeon in a paragraph titles 'Odeon Reloaded'">Guardian</a> and snarky IT industry newsletter <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-07-25" title="NTK issue mentioning Accessible Odeon">NTK</a>. Even Odeon themselves seemed pleased, as they allowed Mr. Somerville to keep the site going as a public service.</p>

<p>Until  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/14/odeon_disabled_website/" title="Register article discussing Odeon's change of heart regarding the Accessible Odeon site">now</a>. Starting on the 22 of June, the increasingly appropriately named Odeon started sending Mr. Somerville strongly-worded emails threatening legal action for copyright infringement, among other things. The company insists they are acting in response to customer concerns about having submitted data to Mr. Somerville without realizing it, and also customer frustration at not being able to book tickets through Mr. Somerville's site.</p>

<p>Odeon's concerns about their customers' personal data are well taken. However, if Odeon has received a significant number of complaints then a significant number of people have chosen an accessible, x-browser site over the mess of nested tables, invalid markup, alt-less images and only-works-in-IE/Win JavaScript that is the official site. Yet rather than fix their own site, Odeon has simply forced the accessible alternative off the web.</p>

<p>Apparently, some folks at Odeon think ignoring the desires of a significant number customers makes good business sense. I wonder if the company's <a href="http://uk.biz.yahoo.com/040702/80/ex8cu.html" title="Yahoo! Finance article about the sale of the Odeon company">prospective buyers</a> know this is the sort of company they're bidding on?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/">Dave Hyatt</a> and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> team have been busy lately adding support for a  number of extensions to html to be used by the upcoming Safari RSS reader and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a>. On the list is IE's <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005905"><code>contenteditable</code></a>, along with a slider widget, search fields, a <code>composite</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> element, and a new <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005913"><code>&lt;canvas/&gt;</code></a> element.</p>

<p>This has generated a fair amount of concern in the web developer community. <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/05/SafariExt">Tim Bray</a> and <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/07/07/wrapped-in-canvas/">Eric Meyer</a> both worry that this heralds a return to the bad old days of the browser wars with everyone just ignoring the standards and making things up for themselves.  Specifically, they point out that instead of trying to put new elements into HTML, they could have used XHTML, which, being XML, is designed to be extensible with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">namespaces</a> or at the very least used a different DOCTYPE. Dave has <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_07.html#005928">responded</a> with an explanation of why they did things the way they did. </p>

<p>Dave argues that the XML and namespaces approach has implementation issues. I'm not enough of an expert on browser internals to say whether this is a cop-out or not, so I guess we'll have to trust him on that. He also says that:</p>

<blockquote><p>"However, this would have dramatically increased the complexity of crafting Dashboard widgets. People know how to write HTML, but most of those same people have never written an XML file, and namespaces are a point of confusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Would the increase in complexity in the markup really be that much of an obstacle? Dashboard widgets seem to me like the kind of thing that would be written by a programmer, or at least have an expectation of being a little more strict than a regular web-page. Besides, web developers have historically shown an incredible aptitude for blindly copy-pasting markup.  There's an awful lot of RDF out on the web. Somebody had to write it. </p>

<p>He also doesn't address the suggestion of at the very least creating their own DTD with their extensions and using a DOCTYPE that points at that DTD. This would go a long way towards alleviating the whole "polluting HTML" concern. I haven't really seen any actual real-world examples of this markup in action, so for all I know they've already done this or are planning to.</p>

<p>While I can understand and respect the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>"In other words, in an ideal world where we had two years to craft Dashboard, maybe we could have used XHTML and SVG, but we aren't living in that ideal world. We can basically manage only one "huge" layout engine feature in a development cycle, and given our developer feedback the choice of HTML editing as the feature to focus on this cycle was clear. We would still love to implement SVG and XSLT and other great technologies in the future, but we simply can't do everything at once."</p></blockquote>

<p>It does sound an awful lot like the "Our customers don't care about standards support. They want fancy new features" excuse that we've been hearing from browser vendors for years and that the WaSP has been actively trying to debunk.</p>

<p>The fact that they're actively working with other browser makers, with the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/">WHAT WG</a>, and seem to have intentions of eventually getting the extensions approved by the W3C is somewhat reassuring.</p>

<p>Overall, though, it's not that big a deal. Safari does an excellent (not perfect) job of supporting the various HTML, XHTML, and CSS specs as they're written and ultimately, that's what's most important. If developers don't want to use the extensions, they don't have to. The vision that the WaSP has been most adamant about is that developers should be able to build sites that conform to the published specs and have them Just Work<sup>TM</sup> in every browser. If browsers want to support additional proprietary extensions on top of that, they're free to do so and the rest of us are free to ignore them. </p>

                                <p>The <code>object</code> element has long been a subject of mystery and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/13/object_and_internet_explorer">frustration</a>. How do we use it? How well is it supported?</p>

<p>As part of the <a href="../../learn/askw3c/index-2.html">WaSP asks the W3C</a> project, we consult the W3C about the correct way to include multimedia elements such as sound, animation and video into our humble (X)HTML pages.
