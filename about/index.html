<h1>WaSP: Fighting for Standards</h1>

	<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org/" title="World Wide Web Consortium home">W3C</a>)
, along with other groups and standards bodies, has established technologies
for creating and interpreting web-based content. These technologies, which we call &#8220;web standards,&#8221; are carefully designed to
deliver the greatest benefits to the greatest number of web users while
ensuring the long-term viability of any document published on the Web.
Please see the sidebar for details.</p>

	<p>Designing
and building with these standards simplifies and lowers the cost of production,
while delivering sites that are accessible to more people and more types
of Internet devices. Sites developed along these lines will continue to function
correctly  as traditional desktop browsers evolve, and as new Internet devices
come to market.</p>

	<p>It sounds so straightforward and makes so much sense. So what&#8217;s the problem? And why is there a Web Standards Project?</p>


	<h2>The Problem</h2>

	<p>Though
leading browser makers have been involved in the creation of web standards
since W3C was formed, for many years compliance was observed in the breach.
By releasing browsers that failed to uniformly support standards, manufacturers
needlessly fragmented the Web, injuring designers, developers, users, and
businesses alike. </p>

	<p>Lack of uniform support for W3C standards left
consumers frustrated: when using the &#8220;wrong&#8221; browser, many could not view
content or perform desired transactions. Among those most frequently hurt
were people with disabilities or special needs.</p>

	<h3>Quandaries and Costs</h3>

	<p>At
the same time, lack of uniform support for W3C standards left designers,
developers and site owners in a terrible quandary: could they afford to implement
multiple versions of every web page in order to accommodate incompatible
browsers? If not, which browsers should they neglect, and how many millions
of potential visitors were they willing to turn away? Either way, the cost
was too high. It still is.</p>

	<p>The fractured browser market added at
least 25% to the cost of developing all sites. Through lack of budget, many
developers produced sites that locked out potential customers. Many developers
who knew about standards saw no point in developing sites for browsers that
did not support them. Others knew little or nothing about standards&#8212;and many
still don&#8217;t, including those at multi-million-dollar agencies who seem to
grasp ASP, Java, Flash MX, and .Net, yet understand almost nothing about
structural markup, style sheets, and the importance of separating structure
from presentation.</p>

	<p>Some designers, stymied by browser incompatibility,
deliberately excluded all but the oldest and most universal web technologies
from their sites. Such sites often succeeded at functioning in all browsers,
but at the cost of limited consumer appeal and functionality.</p>

	<p>Others
relied on visual editors and publishing tools to generate multiple layers
of markup and code optimized for the quirks of various popular browsers.
This wasted money as well as bandwidth, and often generated sites that stopped
working in the next generation of browsers (and never worked at all in alternative
browsers or devices, from screen readers to Lynx to PDAs to less popular
browsers such as Opera). The Web is littered with the corpses of once&#8211;impressive
sites that cannot function in contemporary browsers or devices. Making matters
worse, such sites are still being created every day.</p>

	<p>Some designers
became so frustrated they turned their backs on web standards altogether,
and began to develop exclusively in proprietary environments. Though rich
in creative potential, such technologies suffer from lack of broad accessibility,
and fail to provide for common needs such as bookmarking, printing, copying
and pasting, and other tasks web users must perform on informational and
transactional sites. </p>

	<h3>Born of Necessity</h3>

	<p>In response to
these problems, The Web Standards Project (WaSP) was formed in 1998 with
the goal of promoting core web standards and encouraging browser makers to
do the same, thereby ensuring simple, affordable access for all. </p>

	<p>Though
our message initially met with resistance (particularly from browser companies&#8217;
marketing and P.R. departments), eventually we prevailed&#8212;in part because
engineers at many browser companies agreed with us and saw WaSP as an ally
in their internal battles with management.</p>

	<p>Beginning in 2000, one
leading browser after another delivered on the promise of many of the standards
we had (sometimes shrilly) promoted. Current market-leading browsers, along
with several of their competitors, provide excellent support for HTML 4,
XHTML 1, CSS, ECMAScript (the standard version of JavaScript), and the DOM&#8212;or
are on the road to such compliance.</p>

	<p>Thanks to these browsers, designers
and developers are finally free to build with XHTML and CSS, and in many
cases can separate structure from presentation to maximize portability and
accessibility.  With care, designers and developers may also use the W3C
standard DOM to add sophisticated behavior to their sites.</p>

	<p>So what&#8217;s the problem, and why is there still a Web Standards Project?</p>


	<h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>

	<p>Though
today&#8217;s browsers support standards, tens of thousands of professional designers
and developers continue to use outdated methods that yoke structure to presentation,
in some cases entirely avoiding semantic structures and misusing (X)HTML
as a design tool. Highly paid professionals continue to churn out invalid,
inaccessible sites filled with structurally meaningless markup, huge image
maps, excessively nested tables, and outdated detection scripts that cause
the very usability problems they were originally intended to prevent.</p>

	<p>Many
books on web development still teach outdated methods, and many practitioners
take pride in delivering sites that look and work exactly the same in compliant
and non&#8211;compliant browsers alike, at the cost of accessibility, long&#8211;term
viability, or forward compatibility. Others develop proprietary code that
works only in a handful of popular browsers.</p>

	<p>Thus one of WaSP&#8217;s
primary goals is to provide educational resources that can help our peers
learn standards-compliant methods that are in their interest and that of
their clients and site users.</p>

	<p>Many professionals accomplish their
work by means of visual editing environments  developed at the height of
the Browser Wars. As mentioned above, such tools by default create invalid,
non-semantic sites optimized for 4.0 browser quirks instead of standards.
In 2002, two leading visual editors vastly improved their support for web
standards and accessibility (one of them with help from The Web Standards
Project). But to make use of these improvements, professionals must learn
the basics and benefits of designing and building with web standards. This
again points to the need for developer education.</p>

	<p>Clients and site
managers also need this information if they seek to create sites that are
accessible in today&#8217;s browsers and devices and will remain viable as browsers
and devices evolve. It is WaSP&#8217;s hope that, once informed of the benefits
standards provide,  site owners will stop viewing their sites as a species
of print advertising that must look exactly the same in all environments.
 And that they will focus instead on delivering appropriate content and functionality
within the context of presentations that may vary slightly according to the
needs and capabilities of differing browsers and devices.</p>
