	<h1>Colophon</h1>
	
	<p>The site is written in <a href="../../learn/standards/xhtml/index.html">XHTML</a> 
	Strict with Cascading Style Sheets (<a href="../../learn/standards/css/index.html">CSS</a>).
	Several 
	<a href="http://www.perl.org/"
	   title="Perl - a programming language for manipulating text">Perl</a>
	scripts were used to create the site's directory structure and do the
	dirty work of copying templates and includes to their proper places
	before we could begin to populate the site with content.</p>
	
	<p>The Web Standards Project website was designed by
	<a href="../bios/dallen.html">Dean Allen</a>. 
	<a href="../bios/schampeon.html">Steve Champeon</a> is
	the site architect. The logo was designed by
	<a href="../bios/pfielding.html">Peter Fielding</a>.
	CSS layout was by <a href="../bios/ecostello.html">Eric Costello</a>
	and <a href="../bios/tfahrner.html">Todd Fahrner</a>, with 
	additional production by
	<a href="../bios/bkdelong.html">B.K. DeLong</a> and
	<a href="../bios/deisenberg.html">David Eisenberg</a>.
	Scripting was done by Eric and polished up by the rest of
	the team.</p>
	
	<p><a href="../bios/index.html">Other	members of the Web Standards
	Project</a> contributed	the site content.</p>

	<p>The site is served by the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>
	Web server, on a handmade Pentium III/400 running Linux. More
	detail than that may be gathered in the usual ways. We use the
	<a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">Concurrent Versions System</a>,
	as well as various other CVS clients, to allow the geographically
	disparate members of the group to edit and manage the site.</p>

	<p>Note that there is only one version of the site; there are no
	fancy backend tricks that deliver one site to one browser, and
	another site to another browser. What you get is what everyone
	gets. It's up to your browser to decide what to do with it, which
	is the way that the Web is supposed to work.</p>

	<p>You may notice that many of the pages on this site do not
	use the "http-equiv" meta tag hack to set the content type to be
	associated with the content. This is because our server already
	sends back the appropriate content-type in the HTTP headers, and
	as a result, it is unnecessary and redundant to set it explicitly
	in the HTML markup itself. That some editors do so automatically
	is a sign of their brokenness and the brokenness of older Web
	servers and configurations, and is generally regarded as a pretty
	lame kludge. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/charset.html#h-5.2.2">
	More information about charset declarations in HTML may be found
	here</a>.</p>

	<p>You may see the original version of this website (1998-2001)
	at <a href="http://archive.webstandards.org/">http://archive.webstandards.org</a>.</p>
	
	<hr />
	<p>WaSPs come in many types and sizes. Although they have a
	bad reputation because of their painful sting, they also destroy
	pest insects and provide a minor role in pollination. They generally are
	not aggressive unless roused up.</p>
